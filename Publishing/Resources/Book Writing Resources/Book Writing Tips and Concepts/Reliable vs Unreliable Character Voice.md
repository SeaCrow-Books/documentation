Creating unreliable and reliable character voices is a skillful narrative technique that requires a keen understanding of both character and reader psychology. Here's how you can craft each:

# Unreliable Character Voice:

Contradictions: Have the character contradict themselves in their thoughts, actions, or dialogues. This inconsistency will cast doubt on their credibility.

Selective Memory: The character might conveniently "forget" key details, or their recollection might change from one instance to another.

Bias & Justification: Make it clear that the character has a strong bias or personal agenda. They might continuously justify their actions, even when those justifications seem weak or self-serving.

Emotional Volatility: If a character is overly emotional, their perspective might be seen as skewed or subjective, rather than objective and trustworthy.

Limited Perspective: Deliberately show that the character has a narrow worldview or lacks information, thereby making their perspective unreliable.

Hints from Other Characters: Other characters might subtly (or overtly) challenge or question the narrative of the unreliable character.

Lack of Self-awareness: The character believes they're telling the truth, but it's evident to the reader that they lack self-awareness or are in denial.

# Reliable Character Voice:
Consistency: Ensure the character's recounting of events, feelings, and thoughts remain consistent throughout.

Clarity & Objectivity: This character tends to view situations with a clear head and often without a strong personal bias.

Confirmed Facts: Events or details the character shares are later confirmed by external sources or other characters, validating their reliability.

Emotional Stability: While they can have emotional moments, a reliable character often has a certain level of emotional control, allowing them to recount events without overly dramatizing or downplaying them.

Recognition of Bias: Even if they have biases (as all characters should, to be realistic), a reliable character recognizes and admits to them.

Transparent Motivations: The reader understands the character's motivations, and those motivations align with the character's actions and words.

Trust from Other Characters: Other characters in the story trust this character and turn to them for their perspective or advice.

# Tips:
It's crucial to decide early on whether you want your character to be unreliable or reliable, as this will influence their development throughout the story.

Sometimes, the most compelling stories feature characters that exist somewhere in between these extremes. They may generally be reliable but have specific blind spots that make them unreliable in certain situations.

Remember that the reliability of a character can be subjective. What one reader perceives as unreliable, another might see as perfectly rational based on their own experiences and biases.

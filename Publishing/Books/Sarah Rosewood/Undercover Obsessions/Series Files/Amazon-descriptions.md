## Book 1 - The Heist

**Today, I risk everything for justice.**

They think I am Bella, a spoiled Russian heiress, the daughter of a rich mafia boss.

But it's all a lie.

I am a police officer, operating undercover to bring a ruthless gang of art thieves to justice.

I never thought it would be easy, but no one told me it would be this hard.

My job is to trap Luca. He is dangerous and unforgiving. As a criminal, I should hate him and everything he stands for.

But...

How he looks at me leaves me feeling in a way that I have never felt before. Those eyes seem to see right into my soul. His touch leaves me aching for more.

As I learn more about Luca, I discover that you really canâ€™t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes a man is playing an act to survive in a dangerous world, and underneath hides something different.

I am a professional; I can do my job.

If I can't, then I will have to risk everything for this man.

## Book 2 - The Hideout

**I have risked everything for love.**

I am a police officer in love with a dangerous criminal. 

I have risked everything for this man but the stakes could not be higher. 

We are running from the police, running from a lethal gang, running from ourselves. 

One false step could be lethal.

But it's all a lie. 

Our one chance to escape is a stolen painting that can never be sold. 

I never thought I would be in this situation, risking my life for this man but...

The way he looks at me, the way he makes me feel when he touches me, I am his, completely. He owns me. 

I am alive with him. My true self. 

If only we can keep running and find a way to escape, a way we can love each other completely. 

I risk everything for this man.

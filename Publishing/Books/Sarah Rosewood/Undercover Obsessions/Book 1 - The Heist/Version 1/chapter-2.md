## Luca
 
I sip from my glass of red wine. I'm struck by the bouquet that wafts from the rim – an intricate dance of dark fruits like plums and cherries, underscored by hints of tobacco and oak. I take a sip and the taste unfolds in layers: the velvety texture of aged tannins, a touch of vanilla, and the faintest hint of chocolate and dried figs. The wine feels like liquid velvet, smooth and lush, with a finish that lingers, hinting at its complex origins and the passage of time.
 
I look up at the bar. The place oozes class, just like the people it attracts. High ceilings serve as a canvas for plush chandeliers that, like stars, hang above us, scattering a warm wash of light across the room. Handcrafted mahogany fixtures contribute to the bar's timeless charm, bouncing the hushed light off their polished surfaces. Tucked into a corner, a musician is playing the keys of a grand piano, his fingers dancing over jazz tunes. I’ve never really been a jazz enthusiast, but it fits this place.
 
Rico sits opposite, his bald head gleaming under the subdued bar lights. His eyes, dark and deadly, have a knack for cutting through the crap, like some kind of human X-ray machine. His face is clean-shaven. His uniform never changes, jeans, a t-shirt, and a leather jacket - always black. No fancy threads for Rico, just attire that screams, 'Don't mess with me'. There's something about the way that jacket clings to his broad shoulders like it was made for him, or maybe he was made for it. Either way, it suits him.
 
The booth is all elegance and discretion, which is exactly how I like it. We sit ensconced in leather seats, a gleaming table between us hosting our bottle of superior Italian red. It's an expensive bottle, even for my tastes; I know it's wasted on Rico but we all need our indulgences. As the soothing echoes of jazz fill the dimly lit bar, Rico leans closer, his sharp brown eyes conveying a seriousness I'm familiar with. The last twenty minutes have been filled with a tale of a bunch of Lithuanian thugs who are interfering with his little side hustle - the drug distribution network. Not my thing, but it's right up Rico’s street.
 
Cupping my wine glass, I regard Rico with an amused smirk, my gaze meeting his. "Still clinging to that sinking ship, are we? This isn't some street corner hustle, Rico. We've ascended the ladder and moved beyond street drugs. Why are you so keen on flogging a dead horse?"
 
Rico twirls his wine, the dim light casting flickering shadows on his face. "Your old man gave it to me for my twenty-first birthday, remember?" He chuckles, the sound barely more than a rueful murmur. "Quite the birthday gift, wasn't it?"
 
I can't help but snort at the memory. "You're a nostalgic fool, Rico. We're in the realm of Monets and Picassos now, not strung-out junkies and back-alley deals."
 
A smirk tugs at the corners of Rico's mouth as he slumps back into the booth, gazing at me over the rim of his glass. "What can I say, Luca? I'm a sucker for the old times. I have never understood all that fancy art anyway; we can’t all be like you. I much prefer a street hustle. I like to keep it simple."
 
I smile. I like Rico; he’s as loyal as an old dog. He’s been my constant companion all my life, more like a brother. “Go on, what were you saying?”
 
"So, here's the issue," he says. "These Lithuanians believe they can just muscle in..."
 
Rico's words seem to fade into the plush darkness of the bar, replaced by the sweet cadence of the piano and the swirling rush of my thoughts. Rico - as sturdy as a boulder in a tumultuous sea, a steadfast protector to our family. His loyalty radiates off him like heat from a roaring fire. But loyalty doesn't always align with ambition.
 
My gaze drifts from Rico, landing on the swirling red abyss of my wine glass. I circle the burgundy liquid, my thoughts spinning along with it. My father has become comfortable - too comfortable. He once had a hunger when he was my age but now settles for a single significant art job a year, happy to live off the proceeds while opportunities rise and fall like the tide. But I envision more. My sights aren't chained by tradition or obscured by the old ways. Cybercrime, hacking, digital theft - it's all within reach. I've spent months courting a contact in the US with access to cutting-edge technology. He was willing to give us a piece of the action for a cost and even show us how to establish our setup, but my father rejected it. I'm not content to tread water while the world races ahead. I yearn for more than the rusty throne Vittorio has offered.
 
My grip tightens around the wine glass, the cool stem pressing into my flesh. There's a whole world out there, ripe for the taking. I need to persuade the old man or discover a way to do it without him. I’ll inherit the whole firm eventually, but I can’t wait. Bianca agrees. She said for months that I needed to branch out and be my own man, but what does she know?
 
Rico's voice is consistent in the background, detailing his scuffle with some Lithuanian thug as my gaze wanders around the bar. This habit is a subtle nod to the predator within me, always observing, always vigilant. The bar is a symphony of hushed conversations and clinking glassware punctuated by the gentle tunes spilling from the piano.
 
A flicker of movement captures my attention. It's a woman perched on one of the bar stools, her slender frame encased in a tight black dress. She's elegant. Her style is flawless; the dress clings to her like a lover, hinting without being explicit. She sips a martini, the stem of the glass between her delicate fingers adorned with understated jewelry. Her long hair cascades down her back, a waterfall of rich, brown waves that offset her tanned complexion. The locks hang loose, soft curls framing a face expertly touched with makeup. Her lips are a bold red; her eyes are accentuated with a smoky hue that makes them pop. It's a skillful application, augmenting her features without masking them.
 
She stands out.
 
She’s too perfect. It is as if she’s a manifestation of what someone thinks a rich, sophisticated woman should look like. An aura clings to her, every movement fluid and intentional. Everything about her screams class - from her posture to her attire. Intrigued, I watch as she savors her drink, a world of thoughts dancing behind her captivating gaze.
 
This woman is something else - an undeniable ten. She's tantalizingly attractive.
 
I study her; Rico's words are just a murmur in the background. She lifts her gaze, and our eyes lock. She smiles.
 
Game on.
 
But I am no fool. I know the game—a stunning woman sitting alone in a high-class bar. I know an expensive hooker when I see one. She is just my kind of woman. All business. A pure and simple fuck. Plus, if I'm right, and I am, and she's a prostitute, then paying means I can be as direct as I like without all the moaning and crying afterward. It's worth every penny.
 
"I need to use the pisser," I tell Rico, rising from my seat.
 
He stops talking as I get up.
 
I look at her and she smiles again. It isn’t just a polite, casual smile. No, it was a knowing one, a grin that conveyed a playful challenge, a silent conversation. It was as if she was privy to a secret joke that the rest of the room wasn't in on, a grin that stirred an unfamiliar flutter in my groin.
 
I am already thinking about those lips on my hard cock.
 
I approach her. I feel the electric energy of the bar fade into the background. The amber glow of the dim lights accentuates her features, casting her in an almost ethereal light. I notice the intricate details of her beauty: the soft curve of her jawline, the delicate arch of her eyebrows, and the fullness of her lips that look like the petals of a rose. The perfect whore. I wonder if she can remember when she realized that selling her perfect looks would always pay better than any secretary job. Probably not. I’d heard her story a hundred times. For the second time that night, I think of Bianca.
 
She looks up at me, her eyes reflecting a mixture of surprise and curiosity. The soft glow of the candlelight flickers on the polished bar top, dancing on her face, making her even more enchanting. I take a deep breath and extend my hand.
 
"Hi, I'm Luca," I say, my voice steady and confident. She hesitates, her gaze lingering on my hand before finally taking it.
 
"I'm Crystal," she replies, her voice carrying a hint of a smile, soft and alluring like the rustle of silk. I can sense her initial caution, a subtle wariness that hangs between us like a tenuous thread. Yeah, ‘Crystal,’ probably Sharon, Madison, or some shite. But hey, let’s play along. “Going to buy me a drink?” She holds up the now empty glass.
 
I lean in, my breath caressing her ear. “Well, Crystal, we can do this one of two ways. We can do the dance and pretend you're not a hooker or we can just get to business and cut to what we both want.” I lean back and smile.
 
Her eyes search mine, hesitation flickering for a moment before the flames of anticipation dance in her gaze. A slow, seductive smile graces her lips, and she nods her consent, the unspoken pact between us hanging in the air like a tantalizing secret.
 
Rising from our seats, we brush against each other, a hint of passion that simmers beneath the surface. We step away from the bar, leaving its warm embrace for the cool night air, which swirls around us like a silken caress.
 
Her fingers brush mine.
 
For a split second, my mind flashes back to that moment. I am back at high school, she is there. It's dark. We are in the woods. The trees loom up above us, hiding us from the others. I can hear the party. The light from the nearby bonfire dances on the trees. The shadows reflect on her face. It's summer and the weather is warm. I am wearing shorts and a t-shirt. She is drunk. We are both drunk. One minute we are kissing. I am hard, and excited. It's my first time. Her hands drop to the belt on my shorts. She unbuckles it, opens the buttons, and pulls down the fly. Her hand reaches up, touches the top of the shorts and pulls. The next thing I know, the shorts are around my ankle, I am exposed. There’s laughing. She’s laughing. There are three, no four of them. They point.
 
I shake my head and dismiss the familiar image.
 
I take her arm. She pulls away a little. “That hurts.” She looks down at my hand. It grips her arm. I relax and guide her towards the door.
 
We exit the bar, stepping into the embrace of the night. Around us, the city is alive with its nocturnal symphony, but all noise seems to fade into insignificance next to her presence. The quiet, deserted street stretches out before us, flanked by tall, imposing buildings that are now nothing more than silhouettes against the star-strewn sky. The streetlights overhead flicker on, their dim glow spilling onto the cobblestone pathway. They cast a warm, golden light, painting the scene in soft tones of sepia. Her form, already ethereal within the bar's confines, now illuminates, glowing in the subtle luminescence.
 
Her skin, so fair and soft under the bar's artificial lights, now dips in an inviting hue as if she is bathed in the moon's light. It brings out the delicate contours of her face, the high cheekbones, and the slope of her nose, casting small shadows that give her an almost otherworldly look.
 
We walk against the hushed whispers of the wind and the soft rustle of leaves. The world beyond her feels distant, inconsequential, as I lose myself in the warm glow that the night and streetlights cast upon her. The gentle breeze plays with her hair, brushing it across her face and adding a sense of mystery to her beauty. Arm in arm, we approach the sleek black limousine parked in the car park at the side of the bar, its polished chrome catching the kaleidoscope of city lights. Jim, the driver, a discreet figure in a tailored uniform, acknowledges our presence with a knowing nod and opens the door.
 
This is not my first time bringing some unsuspecting hooker or wannabe fake-titted budget porn star to my limo. They arrive thinking they are in control and leave stretched and bruised like the whores they all are.
 
We slide into the plush leather seats, the door shutting us away from the outside world. The city's cacophony fades, leaving only the two of us.
 
The limousine is a sanctuary of indulgence and discretion, surrounding us in its lavish, velvet cocoon. The gentle hum of the engine combines with the low, sultry notes of jazz drifting from the speakers, crafting an ambiance of seduction and yearning. The play of light and shadow from the tinted windows etches our visages with an aura of an enigma as if we were characters in a clandestine film noir.
 
We recline into the sumptuous leather seats, and I become entranced by Crystal's smoldering beauty. Her luscious lips, painted a provocative deep crimson, call to me like a siren's song. The warmth radiating from her body sets every nerve on fire, sending shivers down my spine.
 
“So,” she says, “do you have a place to go? I have a room at the Plaza; we can go there.”
 
She is confident and poised. Shame it's an illusion.
 
I shift and unzip my trousers. My cock is rock-hard. It springs out. I see a dribble of pre-cum at the end. I know I am big, bigger than average anyway. My foreskin was removed when I was a kid and I think the round end of my cock adds a nice contrast to the thick shaft. I see her look. I can tell she’s impressed.
 
“Suck it,” I say. She hesitates. “Suck it, you fucking bitch.”
 
She looks up at me, a hint of surprise in her eyes. We hold eye contact for a moment. She moves in the seat, positioning herself better. She bends down, one hand cupping her long hair and holding it behind her head so I can see her soft red lips opening as she takes the tip of my cock in her mouth. She is gentle. The lips kissed the end, her tongue flicking out and tasting my pre-cum. I lean back and close my eyes.
 
“Suck it, whore,” I said.
 
She engulfs my cock with her mouth, and pleasure shoots through my body. Her head moves slow, her mouth covering the shaft, her tongue licking the head. She slides up and down in a steady motion, her hand cupping my balls. She is precise. This is not her first blow job. I groan with pleasure.
 
The fact this high-class whore, undeniably a beautiful specimen of womanhood, is bent over me, my cock in her mouth is too much, and I feel myself losing control.
 
She lifts her head, her lips sliding to the end of my cock. Anger flashes through me. I had been clear. I had not told her to stop. I grab the back of her head, fingers wrapping into her hair. I feel her push back, but I hold her head in place. She resists. I push back harder, forcing her mouth onto my cock. I start to thrust my hips upwards, fucking her mouth, using it for my pleasure. I feel her gag, but I don’t stop. She starts to pull away again, but it's too late. I hold her head in place as my cock explodes into her mouth. I let out a long, deep sigh as I feel my cum squirt down her throat. I hold her in place as I finish coming, ensuring every drop fills her mouth. I release her hair, and her head springs up. Her lipstick is smudged, and tears have filled the corners of her eyes.
 
She spits onto the floor of the car. I laugh. “Twat,” she says, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. “That’s going to cost you.”
 
I laugh and pull out my wallet. I open it. A wad of notes greets me. I pull out two, hesitate and pull out a third. I hand them to her. She snatches them from me, snaps open her purse, and pushes them inside.
 
“Nice doing business.” I laugh as she moves to leave the car. I wait for the door to close. “Whore,” I say as I push my now limp cock back into my trousers and prepare to rejoin Rico.

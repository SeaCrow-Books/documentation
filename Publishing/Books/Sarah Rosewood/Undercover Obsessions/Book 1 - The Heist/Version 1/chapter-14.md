I pace in the kitchen at the foot of the stairs, I adjust the cuffs of my designer suit, the silken material a second skin on my tensed muscles. I've been here an hour early, an uncharacteristic lapse in my otherwise impeccable time management. But there’s a difference in this waiting, a weight in the air. Tonight, Bella and I step into the spotlight, fully undercover for the first time. I'm not afraid to admit that I’m a bit nervous about it, a sensation I've almost forgotten.
 
My gaze drifts to the stairs leading to Bella's room. Will she be okay? Can she pull this off? The questions swirl in my head, stirring a low thrum of anxiety. I shake it off, leaning back in my chair. I know what she's capable of. But this... this feels different. Personal.
 
Why? Why do I feel this surge of protectiveness towards her? I’m her mentor, her trainer. It should be about professionalism. Yet, somehow, I've started to see Bella as more than just a fellow crew member. I feel a responsibility for her, a connection, a need to keep her safe. And it’s this need, this feeling that has me on edge.
 
I take a deep breath, forcing my focus back on the task. I need to trust her and our plan. But that doesn't stop the knot in my stomach or the nagging feeling that tonight is going to change everything. I just hope we're ready for whatever that change might be.
 
As Bella appears at the top of the stairs, I'm hit with a moment of breathlessness, like the air has been stolen from my lungs. Her transformation is startling and I can't help but stare, utterly transfixed.
 
She’s dressed in the figure-hugging black dress my father gave her. The gown clings to every curve, cascading down to the floor with an elegant train following her. The sweetheart neckline enhances her slender neck, drawing attention to her collarbones, and it's cut low enough to be tantalizing, but not indecent. The diamond necklace I gave her glitters against her skin, catching the soft light from the overhead chandelier. It's delicate and yet ostentatious, fitting perfectly with her ensemble. And in her hand, she holds the clutch bag I'd picked out for her. Its skull clasp glimmers in the light, adding a touch of rebellious elegance to her overall appearance. Her dark hair is styled in a loose updo, a few stray tendrils framing her face, accentuating her radiant olive skin and those mesmerizing brown eyes. She looks like a Mediterranean goddess descended from the heavens. I'm captivated, entranced. All thoughts about our mission seem to evaporate from my mind, replaced by this vision of Bella, so stunning, so out of reach.
 
My heart hammers in my chest and a strange feeling surges through me. It's more than just lust, more than just admiration. It's a deep longing, a fierce desire that makes my blood boil and my senses tingle. For the first time in a very long time, I feel deeply attracted to someone. And that someone is Bella.
 
I want her. I swallow, hoping to quench the dryness in my throat. I need to fuck her. To own her. To make her mine. To feel my cock slip inside her. To cover my face in her juices…
 
"You look... amazing," I manage to say, barely a whisper.
 
I pull Bella into a hug and the scent of her perfume hits me, a mix of vanilla and something floral, light but intoxicating. It floods my senses, sending a shiver down my spine. Her body is warm and soft against mine, fitting perfectly into my arms. I can feel the steady rhythm of her heart against my chest, mimicking the beat of my heart that's pounding in my ears. For a moment, I allow myself to close my eyes, to lose myself in the feel of her against me, in her scent, in the reality that Bella is here, in my arms. Desire burns in my veins like molten lava, powerful and untamed.
 
I know I am hard. I can feel my cock throbbing, pre-cum coating my boxers. She must be able to feel me too, but I don’t care. I want her to feel my cock pressing against her, to know that I need to be inside her.
 
I step back, breaking the intimate embrace, but not before I let my hand linger a little longer on the small of her back. I clear my throat, pushing back the desire bubbling inside me.
 
"Ready to go?" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady to hide the storm of emotions inside me.

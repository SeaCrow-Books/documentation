## Luca
 
My heart pounds in my chest as I observe Bella advancing towards the warehouse entrance from within the car. The reality of our predicament hits me like a punch to the gut, stirring a cocktail of anger and a sense of betrayal. I tell myself I want to shield her from harm and protect her but the reality is that I am sending her to meet a killer alone.
 
My fingers are clenched around the steering wheel, the whiteness of my knuckles a stark contrast to the dark interior of the car. My gaze is glued to the door, anticipating any signs of danger. My mind plays out multiple perilous scenarios, each escalating in danger, but I stifle the rise of fear. I've weathered worse storms and am resolved to safeguard Bella at all costs.
 
Moments turn into an agonizing stretch of silence. Unable to stand the wait any longer, I reach for my gun, verify its loaded, and prepare for action. Stepping out of the car, I take a deep breath, the frigid night air slicing through me. With my eyes locked on the warehouse entrance, I advance, firearm poised and ready. Each stride feels like an epoch, and the burden of my choice weighs heavily on my conscience. I put aside thoughts of the future and the repercussions of my actions – the sole focus now is Bella's protection.
 
As I arrive at the door, I halt, straining my ears for any sounds emanating from within. Hearing nothing, I steady my hold on the gun and nudge the door open, stepping into the dark abyss of uncertainty that lurks within.
 
It takes a moment for my eyes to adapt to the poorly lit environment. Sparse, feeble overhead lights cast a ghostly luminescence on the frosty concrete floor, making the shadows seem like they were trying to swallow everything in sight. Towering shelves bearing layers of dust-coated boxes and forsaken tools line the walls. Deserted, rusted machinery stands as silent witnesses to the relentless march of time, forming a desolate wasteland of industrial remnants. The air is dense with the aroma of oil, dampness, and decay, each breath filling my lungs with a sense of dereliction. Bella stands close to the entrance, her hands uplifted in a gesture of surrender, a vivid demonstration of her vulnerability. Fear widens her eyes as they flit across the room, frantically seeking an escape route from this treacherous predicament. The tension gripping her body is tangible as she remains immobilized, uncertainty flooding her thoughts. The bag with the invaluable artwork lies at her feet.
 
My focus shifts across the room. I am expecting to see Rico, hands outstretched, gun ready to fire but it is Bianca that comes into view. Cloaked in a sleek black ensemble, she appears to dissolve into the darkness. Her hair is yanked back into a no-nonsense ponytail, outlining a face void of emotion. Her frosty, strategic eyes are fixed on Bella, emanating a daunting intensity that sends a tremor down my spine. A hand gun is clenched in her hand, pointing directly at Bella.
 
The room vibrates with tension, each passing moment echoing like a drawn-out eternity.
 
Bianca's lips contort into a wicked grin, and she swivels her icy gaze my way. "Ah, Luca," she says in a seductive purr. "Your presence here doesn't surprise me. I had a hunch you two were an item. I knew this little bitch couldn’t keep a secret." Her eyes dart back to Bella, who mirrors my bafflement.
 
“Bianca,” I say. “Put the gun down, we can talk about this. There’s still a chance we can all just walk away from this.”
 
Bianca looks at me and back at Bella. She smiles. "So, has lover boy told you about us yet?" Bianca questions me; her voice laced with venom.
 
Bella's eyes expand, her bewilderment deepening as she digests Bianca's insinuations. I can perceive the dawning hurt and sense of betrayal seeping into her expression.
 
"What is she talking about, Luca?" Bella demands, her voice barely audible.
 
Bianca erupts into laughter. "Oh, he didn’t spill the beans, did he?" She scoffs, taking pleasure in the anguish her revelations are sparking. "Luca and I have been intimate for quite some time. He had been happily fucking his father’s wife for years. Isn't that so, lover?"
 
My heart tightens with remorse and humiliation as I remain standing, incapable of denying the blatant truth. I stutter, groping for the right words. "It's not what you're thinking, Bella," I implore, but my plea lacks credibility.
 
Bella's gaze hardens as she scrutinizes me, a cocktail of fury and heartache brewing in her expression. "It seems blatantly obvious to me, Luca," she retorts, her tone icy and unrelenting.
 
Bianca chortles. "Awww, are you lovebirds having a tiff?" She mocks, swinging her firearm casually between us. "How adorable. Seems that she’s not happy with sloppy seconds.” She laughs. “Did he do that thing where he gets all dominant and takes off his belt? I am sure he practices that in the mirror.” She looks to Bella; anger flashes across her face. Bianca looks back at me. “Tutt tutt Luca, your games are getting old.”
 
“Shut the fuck up,” I say. The words spit out into the gloom.
 
Bianca shrugs. “But let's not stray from the matter at hand, shall we?"
 
I can feel the situation spilling from my control; seeing Bianca, not Rico, has knocked me off balance. "Why are we here, Bianca? Why are you after the painting?"
 
Bianca's smirk returns, her eyes reflecting calculated cruelty. "Why? Why do you think Luca? You know me as well as anyone; why would I do this?”
 
I take a breath. “Money.” I pause. “Or power. Both probably. You have some kind of scheme worked out.”
 
She smiles. “Pretty good.” She looks over at Bella. “We have history, you know.” She allows the word history to hold in the air. “Close Luca. It's mostly because of that bloated, decrepit man you address as your father. You know, I've always been about the money, Luca. I endured him and his pitiful lifestyle solely for the financial benefits. But it came with a price, having to live with him daily, putting up with his sweating body and tiny prick. Pretending I gave a shit. The problem with pretending is that, at some point, you have to stop and be true to yourself. And now, with this artwork, I can bid it all goodbye and live happily ever after.”
 
Her revelation leaves me reeling, a sense of betrayal slicing through me. She's been exploiting my father's wealth all along and is now attempting to seize an opportunity that threatens to shatter us all. My fists tighten, resolute in my determination to prevent her from achieving her goal.
 
"A bit of a conundrum, don't you think, lover boy," Bianca taunts, her eyes fixed on me. "So…,” she shifts her weight, her body facing me but her gun still trained on Bella, “let's not forget about her." She gestures with her gun towards Bella. "This little tattle tale. Tell me, Luca, what's it like sleeping with a cop?"
 
Bella glares at Bianca, a mix of rage and disbelief clouding her expression. "How did you figure out I'm a cop?"
 
Bianca grins, a cunning look in her eyes. "I didn't. Not until you confirmed it just now. I had my suspicions when I came across the burner phone. It had only one number stored, which struck me as odd. I dialed the number, and it connected me to some Russian joint. I knew then you were up to something. You were either a cop or a Russian double-crossing Vittorio. But to be honest, I don't care if you're law enforcement or a corrupt mobster. It's all the same to me; I'm just after the painting."
 
Bella meets my gaze, determination set in her expression. "She's getting the painting," she proclaims.
 
Bianca's smirk reappears. "Good girl. She’s a good girl, right Luca?"
 
"No," I contest, my grip tightening on my weapon.
 
My eyes dart between Bella and Bianca as the gun swings in my direction, a shiver of dread coursing down my spine.
 
"So, Luca, what's it going to be? What’s your play? Here, I'll simplify it for you. What's to stop me from shooting you, then her, and just taking the painting?"
 
I attempt a casual shrug. "What's to prevent me from shooting you and claiming the painting for myself?"
 
Bianca's eyes widen in disbelief. "Really?" she challenges. "Would you dare betray your father? He'd have your head. You'd be on the run for the rest of your life. You'd gamble all that for a bitch like her? Besides, she's a cop; she'd bear witness to murder. She’s going to shop you the first moment she gets; if she doesn’t, if you come up with some little happy ever after, it's just a matter of time. That guilt will gnaw at her; she’ll wake every morning next to a thief and murderer, knowing that just one phone call and she can go back to her normal life. She is a cop, face it no judge will convict her. She’ll spin a story and they will lock you up and throw away the key. It was just a matter of time. Eventually, she'd have to disclose everything. Let's face it, Luca, you are fucked. You shoot me and you'll have to kill her, too."
 
She's mistaken. Bella would never turn on me.
 
Would she?
 
I hold Bianca's stare, my thoughts spinning with visions of life on the run with Bella.
 
The painting is worth a fortune, priceless. I have the contacts to sell it; I’d not get the real value, but enough to escape. We could leave the country, assume new identities, and carve out a fresh existence. I see a humble home in an obscure French village in Loire Valley, where our pasts and secrets are unknown. Days full of simple chores and peaceful moments, cultivating our own food, engaging in long walks together, constructing a serene life far from the turmoil we've left behind. I would paint and there could be children.
 
Of course, we'd face hurdles, forever glancing over our shoulders, questioning when our past might finally catch up. But we'd confront them as a team, shoulder to shoulder.
 
Yet, a trace of uncertainty nags at me.
 
Can I genuinely discard everything I've known – my father, the mob, the life I've lived until now – all for Bella? Given our tainted histories, is it even feasible to envision a life together?
 
And is Bianca right? Would Bella eventually betray me?
 
I glance at Bella, her eyes reflecting a blend of terror and resolve, and my heart surges with a potent sense of guardianship. In that instant, I realize I'm prepared to gamble everything for her, to struggle for a shot at a life together, no matter how perilous or unpredictable that future might be.
 
Taking a deep breath, I reach my decision.
 
"Yes," I affirm, "I'd risk everything for her."
 
Bianca cackles, leveling her gun at Bella. "Change of plans," she announces. "I shoot her, and you run away with me. We offload the painting, divide the cash, and part ways. What do you say?"
 
My mind whirls with the implications of her new proposition.
 
I attempt to fathom leaving Bella behind, a lifeless, bleeding body, all for the sake of the painting and the wealth it could generate. I visualize fleeing with Bianca, the guilt of Bella's death a crushing burden. We'd sell the painting, walk away with a substantial fortune, and I'd be left alone, dealing with the fragments of my broken life. Could I live with myself if I choose this path? What kind of man would that make me?
 
I picture a life without Bella, one where I return to the criminal underworld, numb and hardened from my decision to sacrifice the woman I love. Money would be plentiful, but my heart would be empty, haunted by the memory of what I had done.
 
I think about what I've glimpsed earlier – a life on the run with Bella, filled with love and hope despite the uncertainty and danger. A life where we face challenges together, have each other's back, and the warmth of our love drowns out the shadows of our past. I know I can't abandon Bella for the cold comfort of wealth and a life without her. I can't trade her life for a chance at riches, especially when I know that money can't replace what we have together.
 
I look at Bianca, my gaze steady. "I'm sorry."
 
My finger tightens on the trigger, and the gun roars to life. The bullet slams into Bianca's chest, shattering her sternum and tearing through her heart. Her eyes widen in shock and pain as a dark crimson stain spreads across her chest, the blood soaking into her clothes. Bianca's body jerks, her arms flailing as she loses control and begins to spin. As she turns, the force of the gunshot propels her off balance, and she stumbles backward. Bianca hits the floor with a strangled gasp, her limbs sprawled out in an unnatural, twisted position.
 
Bella screams and drops to her knees, her hands covering her face.
 
"What have you done?" she cries out, her voice shaking. "What have you done, Luca?"
 
I look at her. "What I had to. I put a bullet in her and saved your life, Bella. Our lives."
 
Bella sobs. “What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?” Her body is wracked with shock and grief. I bend down, pick up the gun from Bianca's lifeless hand, and hoist the bag with the painting over my shoulder. I grab Bella by the wrist, feeling her trembling as I pull her to her feet.
 
"We have to go, Bella," I urge, my voice gentle but insistent. “Now.”
 
Bella's tears stream down her face as we approach the car, her sobs echoing through the desolate industrial estate. I wrap my arm around her shoulders, trying to provide some comfort and support despite the turmoil of emotions inside me. I guide her to the passenger side, open the door, and help her into the front seat. Her eyes are red and swollen, and her breathing is ragged from the intensity of her crying. I brush a stray strand of hair away from her face. "It's going to be okay, Bella. I promise."
 
I close the door and walk to the driver's side, sliding into my seat and starting the engine. The car roars to life, and I glance over at Bella, her tear-streaked face a testament to the ordeal we have just experienced. I squeeze her hand, offering a small, reassuring smile. I pull away, leaving behind the darkened unit.

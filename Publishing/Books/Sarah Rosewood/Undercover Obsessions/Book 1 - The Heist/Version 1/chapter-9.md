## Bella
 
The diner's door swings open before us, releasing a rush of warmth and the mouth-watering aroma of coffee into the cool morning air. Luca holds the door open for me and I step into a bustling hive of activity. Waitstaff weave through tightly packed tables with practiced grace, their trays loaded with piping hot plates of food. The interior is a blend of the modern and the homely, clean lines softened by cushions and drapes in earthy tones. The walls are adorned with artful black and white photographs of what I assume are local landmarks. The wooden floor is worn smooth by countless feet, and the ceiling-high windows allow the early morning light to fill the room with a soft, welcoming glow.
 
I stand there, soaking in the ambiance, while Luca scans the room. He straightens, his gaze locking onto something - or someone - across the room. I follow his gaze to see Rico, seated at a corner booth, his attention focused on the steaming mug of coffee in his hands. Luca gives my arm a light squeeze, a silent signal that we should move forward, and together, we begin to navigate through the early morning crowd.
 
We maneuver our way through the busy diner, eventually coming upon Rico. He hunches over a coffee cup, steam wafting off the dark liquid. Rico, even seated, is a formidable sight. His head is shaved, his clean-shaven face marked by sharp, rugged lines that speak of a life not easily lived. His piercing brown eyes are unnerving, seeming to see past the surface to your very core. Despite his intense gaze, it's his intimidating physicality that really strikes me. His broad, muscular frame is a testament to his readiness for any situation, and he carries a sense of dangerous potential about him. He's dressed simply, yet his clothes somehow enhance his air of masculinity. He wears jeans, worn but fitting perfectly to his solid build, and a simple T-shirt, its fabric stretched over his muscled torso. Over this, he's thrown a leather jacket, its worn texture hinting at its age and use.
 
The waitress approaches our table, her appearance a stark contrast to Rico's ruggedness. She's in her mid-thirties, an easy-going smile softening her otherwise angular features. Her hair, an enticing chestnut hue, is bundled into a messy bun, a few loose strands framing her face. Crow's feet at the corners of her sparkling blue eyes, no doubt from years of heartfelt laughter and living, add a warm touch to her visage. Her apron, smudged with the day's fare, somehow enhances her friendly, approachable aura. She smoothly transitions to business with a pencil tucked behind her ear and a notepad in hand.
 
"What can I get you folks this morning?" she asks in a voice that's as warm as her demeanor.
 
"Coffee, please," I respond, my request echoed by Luca. Rico shakes his head, seemingly content with his steaming cup of dark coffee.
 
As the waitress retreats to fetch our order, a hush descends upon our little corner of the diner. The murmur of nearby conversations and the occasional clatter of dishes from the kitchen fill the void, the atmosphere teetering on the edge of discomfort. I can't help but notice the tension that the silence brings, the quiet emphasizing the contrast between the private Luca I had spent the evening with, and the man sitting across from me now. The difference is stark, it's almost as if he's two different people - one in public and another in private.
 
Last night, Luca had been caring, attentive, even gentle in a way I hadn't expected. We shared thoughts, laughter, and a connection I hadn't anticipated. Now, in the cold light of day, amidst the hustle of the diner and under Rico's hawkish gaze, that Luca seemed to have receded, replaced by the more stern, businesslike persona I'd seen in our first meeting. I couldn't help but wonder which one was the real him, or if they were both facets of the complex man he is.
 
Sipping on my coffee, I let my mind drift back to the car ride over. Luca had been quiet, almost moody. His silence hung in the air like a thick fog, his brooding gaze fixed on the road, his mind clearly preoccupied with thoughts he wasn't sharing. I'm well aware I'm stepping onto a chessboard of complexity with these men. Each move, every word, has a weight and a consequence. I'm here to do a job, to navigate through this intricate world, not to decipher the layers of a man like Luca. He is an enigma wrapped in a riddle and I'm not sure where I stand with him, which is unnerving. I know I have to tread lightly, maintain my professional distance. I can't afford to let myself get drawn into an emotional whirlpool. Personal feelings have no place in this. I'm not here to make friends. But Luca, with his dichotomy of personas, makes that a little harder than I had expected.
 
The waitress returns, a tray balanced effortlessly in her hand. Setting down our coffee with a practiced ease, she flashes us a quick smile before returning to the bustle of her duties, leaving us alone once more in our bubble of uneasy quiet. Turning my attention back to the table, I watch Luca shift in his seat and clear his throat.
 
"Let's get down to business," he announces, his tone firm, his gaze sharp.
 
Luca pulls out a map from a slim folder he's been carrying, laying it flat on the table between the cups of coffee. He starts pointing out locations on the map with the tip of his finger, his focus completely engrossed in the matter at hand.
 
"See here," he begins, his finger tracing a route along the streets of the city, "This is the main route we'll take to get in. We'll use the car, inconspicuous, blends with the traffic. The location is here," he points to a building marked with a small 'x', "We park here." His finger moves to a lane marked with a circle. "And if we run into trouble," he continues, moving his finger to a series of interconnected lines, "These are our possible escape routes." His finger rests on a small star marked on the map. His eyes flicker up to meet ours, ensuring we're following along.
 
He turns his attention to Rico, who's been quietly sipping his coffee. "What do you think?" Luca asks. His question hangs in the air for a moment, followed by a tense silence. Rico grunts in reply, not looking up from his cup.
 
Leaning back in my chair, he crosses his arms and fixes his gaze on Rico. "What's wrong, Rico?"
 
"Nothing," Rico grunts out, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
 
Luca shakes his head, his eyes never leaving his. "We've known each other too long for you to lie to me, man."
 
Rico seems to be wrestling with himself in a moment of silence. "Fine. You really want to know?"
 
"Yes," Luca confirms without hesitation, "I do."
 
Rico sighs his face a mixture of frustration and annoyance. "Fine," he says sharply, his gaze darting towards me, "It's her." He gestures in my direction, the mistrust apparent in his eyes.
 
"Fuck sake, Rico, I thought we dealt with this yesterday.” Rico looks at Luca. Luca sighs. “OK. What about her?" Luca questions, the casual tone of his voice gone, replaced by a dangerous calm.
 
Rico's eyes narrow as he meets Luca's gaze. "I don't get why we have to fucking trust her. Am I the only one who thinks this is all a bit fucked up? She rocks up from God knows where and moves in with you, making herself at home. She could be filth for all we know." His voice grows louder, echoing through the quiet diner.
 
Luca's patience is wearing thin. His jaw clenches, his eyes taking on a hard look. "You know the score, Rico," he retorts, "My father has vetted her. He trusts her, so we trust her." His tone is threatening now, the warning clear.
 
Rico's fists clench at his sides, his voice raising in pitch. "And now she’s sitting here and we're discussing the final details of something that could get us locked up for a long time. It's not right," he exclaims, his anger spilling over. “You know that just planning this is a crime, right?” His voice is barely a whisper, but the zone is harsh.
 
I am impressed. I had assumed that the finer points of criminal law would be wasted on a brute like Rico, but once again, he surprises me and I realize I have underestimated him again. That’s twice. I vow there will not be a third time.
 
Luca stares at him, his cool demeanor contrasting sharply with Rico's heated outburst. "Look, man, this is not your call to make. If you're not happy, you can always walk," he counters, his voice laced with challenge.
 
Rico shoots up from his seat, all eyes in the diner now on us. "You're not my boss, Luca," he shouts, his nostrils flaring.
 
Luca remains seated, his eyes drilling into Rico. With a dangerous calm in his voice, he replies, "Yes, I am." The tension in the air is palpable. I find myself holding my breath, watching the exchange between the two men.
 
As I watch Luca rise from his seat and confront Rico, I can't help but feel a jolt of fear. His commanding presence fills the room, tension crackling in the air like static electricity. The diner has gone silent.
 
"My father says she's okay," Luca asserts, his gaze unyielding as he meets Rico's glare. "That should be enough for you. However, I say she's okay and that IS enough for you. If you have a problem, now is the time to say. What about it, Rico? You got an issue?"
 
Rico holds Luca's gaze for an uncomfortably long moment, his anger palpable. He breaks eye contact and slumps back into his seat, the fight leaving him. "No, I don't have a problem," he mumbles, not meeting anyone's eyes. “Boss.” The word is a hiss.
 
"Good," Luca replies, the intensity in the room ebbing as he sits back down. The room springs back into chatter. He draws in a deep breath, and for the first time since this confrontation started, I find myself exhaling. "Now, let's all calm down."
 
The waitress returns at that moment; her brows furrowed in concern. "Everything okay here?" she asks, her gaze darting between us.
 
"Everything's fine," Luca assures her with a friendly smile. “My friend here was insisting that The Rolling Stones are a better band than The Beatles. I was explaining to him that he was mistaken. He’s now started to see the error of his ways.” Luca smiles, nods, turns, and walks away.
 
Luca his attention returns to Rico. "Rico, I understand your concerns, but your job is to keep us safe, not to worry. That's my job."
 
Rico gives a curt nod, and silence settles once more. Luca glances between us, his gaze resting on me a moment longer than necessary before he speaks again. "I think it might be better if we continue this later." He begins to gather the maps on the table, folding them neatly before sliding them into his folder. He places money on the table, way more than is needed to cover the coffees and stands.
 
As I trail behind Luca, I struggle to process what just happened. Luca – Luca, of all people – had just stood up for me. For a moment, I let that sink in. The guy who always seemed to put himself first defended me against a known killer. I glance at his back, my mind whirling with a new perception of him. For all his aloofness and detached persona, there was a force I hadn't seen before, a raw assertiveness that had just roared to life in my defense.
 
I hadn't expected him to come to my aid. Not so openly. Not so... fiercely. But he had. And I have to admit, it was... attractive.
 
A wave of warmth rushes over me, confusing and intense. I suddenly find myself looking at Luca in a whole new light. The man I'd pegged as self-serving and detached had just shown a level of protective loyalty that both shocked and intrigued me. My heart pounded as we left the diner, the door chiming shut behind us. T
 
he morning sun was already beginning to heat up the pavement, and I blinked against its brightness, my mind still spinning from the revelation of Luca's unexpected defense.
 
My eyes travel over Luca as he strides ahead of me, his broad shoulders set with an air of authority that now seems so much more appealing. His casual attire – a simple black shirt tucked into dark jeans – did nothing to hide the lean muscles that moved with an easy grace under the fabric. I admire how his dark hair catches the sunlight, creating a halo of soft light around his head. Heat rises in my cheeks as I realize I'm ogling him – this man who I'm supposed to be working with, not fantasizing about. But I can't help it. The events in the diner... they've changed something. I feel an unfamiliar pull, a sudden intrigue I can't ignore.
 
It's not just his physical attractiveness, which is undeniable, but the strength of his character that had revealed itself back there. The way he stood up for me, his uncompromising assertiveness, it was... compelling.
 
I shake my head, attempting to clear my mind. This is not the time for distractions. Yet, as I watch Luca’s back retreating, I can't help the whisper of excitement that flutters in my stomach.

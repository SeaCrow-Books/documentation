## Luca
 
The tires crunch on the gravel driveway as I approach my father's mansion. I can feel my teeth grinding in irritation as I kill the engine and step out of the sleek black car. The grandeur of my father's place does nothing to lighten my mood. Expensive cars are parked in the driveway, and the house is lit like a beacon in the darkness, symbolizing the Vella family's power and wealth. Yet, to me, it's more a prison than a palace.
 
Storming up the steps to the heavy oak door, I stride into the grand foyer, the heels of my polished shoes clicking on the pristine marble floor. My eyes lock onto the study door at the end of the hallway. I take a moment to compose myself.
 
Bianca appears in the hallway, a stark contrast to the opulence of the mansion around us. Her cashmere sweater hangs loosely over her, the rich burgundy color complementing her olive skin. She pairs this with high-waisted jeans that accentuate her slender figure, and simple gold hoop earrings dangle from her ears. Her feet are bare, a surprising but not altogether unfamiliar sight. Bianca often preferred the comfort of bare feet over the constraints of designer shoes.
 
The hallway exudes a luxurious comfort. Dark oak walls, rich in their well-kept sheen, serve as a canvas to this space. The defining feature, however, is the antique Persian rug that sprawls beneath our feet. Its intricate patterns woven into vibrant reds, blues, and earthy browns punctuate the room with a storytelling all its own. This rug is a relic of far-off lands and centuries-old traditions, giving a sense of richness that the wooden floor alone cannot provide. Its plush thickness softens each footfall, adding unexpected tranquility to the hallway. This grand yet welcoming space serves as a fitting introduction to the world of the Vellas.
 
"Luca," she says, surprise lighting up her dark eyes as they land on me. "I wasn't expecting you. Your dad's not home," she informs me, her eyes scanning my tense expression. "He won't be back for a couple of hours. He had some business to attend to."
 
The news does nothing to quell my irritation, but I manage to keep my tone level. "I need to speak to him, Bianca. It's about Bella."
 
A flicker of understanding lights up her eyes, and she nods, crossing her arms over her chest. "I see. You'll have to wait then unless you want to discuss it with me." She shrugs a hint of challenge in her tone. Bianca is not the type to back down, especially regarding the family business.
 
"I'm not thrilled about Bella moving into my place," I grumble, the words spilling out before I can contain them. "Its my space, my home. I don't need some spoiled rich kid messing with it."
 
Bianca's gaze remains steady on me as I vent my frustrations. "Luca," she begins in a soothing tone, "I understand. But you know how your Dad is. He trusts you more than anyone else. He needs you to keep an eye on her."
 
I scoff, but the fight slowly drains from me. "Yeah, I get it. I'm his watchdog."
 
Bianca shakes her head. "It's not like that, Luca. It's just... Bella's an unknown variable. Your dad doesn't trust unknown variables."
 
"Yeah, I get it," I repeat, my tone resigning.
 
Bianca's words have managed to calm me, my anger giving way to a sense of duty. I might not be thrilled about Bella Gordievsky invading my space, but if it means pleasing my father, then so be it.
 
"Luca," Bianca starts, leaning against the dark mahogany side table in the hallway. The dimmed lights cast a soft glow on her, lending an aura of intensity to her features.
 
"What is it, Bianca?" I ask, my voice unintentionally gruff.
 
"Do you ever consider our family's future? Where we're heading?" Her question hangs in the air between us like a ghostly specter, her words laced with a disturbing undercurrent that sends a prickling sensation along my spine.
 
"Of course I do," I respond, a hint of defensiveness creeping into my tone. The accusation veiled in her question strikes a raw nerve. This is not the first time we have had this conversation, but always outside the earshot of my father. "Our family's future is always on my mind. Why would you ask something like that?"
 
"Luca," she exhales a sigh, pinning me with her unwavering gaze, "Can't you see? Our family's future does not lie with your father anymore. He's not the one who should be at the helm."
 
My heart hammers in my chest at her audacious claim. "Bianca, My father is the one who laid the foundation. He's the leader. Always has been, always will be."
 
"But that's where you're wrong, Luca," she counters, her eyes searing into mine. "Your father isn’t the man he once was; he’s getting old and soft. We all know that you should be the one leading us. You have the mind for it, the strategic thinking, the calmness under pressure. You were born for it."
 
"Bianca, this is dangerous talk," I warn her, my voice dropping to a whisper. #
 
"Maybe it's time for some danger, Luca," she continues, her voice steady and confident, "The future belongs to those who seize it. And you were born to seize it."
 
A maelstrom of emotions surge within me. Shock, fear, ambition, and a myriad of other sentiments blend into an intoxicating concoction. I've thought about the reins of power in my hands, the future of our family molded by my decisions. But the path to that future, painted with betrayal and inherent danger, scares me. However, Bianca's words burrow into my mind, planting the seeds of ambition deeper. I remain silent, taking in her words, the weight of the potential future resting heavily on my shoulders. The path ahead has never seemed more alluring yet so fraught with uncertainty.
 
Bianca smirks as she steps closer, her coy demeanor resurfacing. "And what do you think of our mysterious Bella?"
 
"Bella?" I ask, struggling to keep the surprise from seeping into my voice. "She's... err… interesting," I respond, choosing my words carefully.
 
Bianca's smirk grows into a knowing smile, a playful glint dancing in her eyes. "Interesting, huh?" She echoes my words, her voice dripping with amusement. "She's attractive, isn't she? In a nerdy sort of way?"
 
It's my turn to smirk. I can't help but feel a slight tug at my lips. "Bianca, since when do you find 'nerdy' attractive?" I shoot back, trying to divert the attention back to her.
 
"Oh, I didn't mean for me," she clarifies a hint of mischief in her voice. She reaches out, touching my arm lightly. "I meant for you. Do you have a little crush on our Bella?"
 
I recoil, pulling my arm away as if burned. "No." The word erupts from me, louder than I intended. "Of course not."
 
Bianca laughs, the sound echoing through the hallway. Bianca, her flirtatious demeanor unwavering, gazes up at me with teasing eyes. "Do you think she's prettier than me?" she asks, her voice softer now, barely above a whisper.
 
"No," I respond, my tone adamant. There's no hesitation, no second thoughts. The comparison is absurd. "Bella might be cute in a tomboyish way, but you..." I pause, my gaze trailing over her, drinking in her every detail. "You're a real woman, Bianca," I continue, my voice deeper, a touch of genuine admiration seeping into my words. "You're not just pretty...you're beautiful. You're the kind of woman a real man would want."
 
It's the truth. Bianca is stunning, there's no denying that. But beyond her looks, she possesses a charm and grace that few can match. She carries herself with strength and poise that's captivating. Bella, on the other hand, is...different. Her beauty is more understated, more subdued. She's attractive, yes, but in a less conventional, more quirky way.
 
Bianca smirks, her eyes narrowing. "Sounds like you're quite taken with her already, Luca. I never thought I'd see the day when you'd be captivated by a girl who dresses like a boy. Perhaps you are turning a little gay. Didn’t your dad used to say you were a bit of a sissy when you went through that painting phase?"
 
“Fuck off,” I say, shaking my head. "It's not like that, Bianca. I'm just... intrigued, that's all.
There's something different about her, and I can't quite put my finger on it."
 
She steps closer, her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I feel a familiar tension between us. Bella might be interesting, but Bianca is drop-dead gorgeous, with legs that never quit, tits to die for, and a pussy from heaven.
 
I feel my cock twitch.
 
“Show me how pretty you think I am,” Bianca says.
 
I hesitate for a moment, caught in her spell. A wave hits me. Who is she to start teasing me? She’s just my father’s whore.
 
I move my hand to the back of her head. I push her forward, forcing her to kiss me. She resists for a moment and then leans in with a light moan. Our lips part, and my tongue pushes into her mouth. I feel her tongue push back, exploring. I pull away, a sudden fire in me.
 
I step back from her and take in her body. Her sweater is tight, and the shape of her tits is clear through the material. The jeans follow the curve of her ass and legs. I let her see my eyes exploring her body. She says nothing as we stand for a moment.
 
“Take off the sweater,” I say. She looks back; her eyes showing a flash of resistance. ‘Take the fucking sweater off, now.” I make sure that I say the words in a slow and deliberate manner, emphasizing each, allowing my body to grow a little bigger, and intentionally intimidating her.
 
How dare she fuck with me? She is right, I should be the leader of this family, and she needs to take heed of her own words.
 
Her hands drop to the bottom of the sweater, gripping the material and pulling it up and over her head. She throws the sweater to the floor. I watch it drop and allow my eyes to return to her body. She's clad only in a red lace bra and well-fitted jeans, her taut midriff bare, skin glowing under the dimmed lights. Her curves, usually hidden, are now in full view. Her bra is a tantalizing display of lace and seduction, the deep red hue a stark contrast against her soft, fair skin. It's delicate yet provocative, providing a tantalizing glimpse of the hidden treasures. I can see the outline of her body through the fine lace, her ample cleavage hinting at the fullness that lies beneath.
 
‘Now the jeans,’ I say my hand indicating I want them removed. She hesitates. I take a tiny step forward.
 
‘Ok, ok,’ she says, lifting her hands in surrender. ‘For fuck’s sake,’ the words are almost a whisper for her more than me.
 
Bianca reaches for the button on her jeans, her movements slow and deliberate, each one calculated for maximum impact. She pops the button free, her gaze never leaving mine as she unzips the jeans with a slow, tantalizing pull. Her fingers hook into the waistband, peeling the denim down her hips and thighs. The jeans pool at her feet, leaving her standing in front of me in just her matching red lace knickers.
 
The sight of her is breathtaking. Her knickers are as provocative as her bra, the fine lace barely providing any coverage. They sit low on her hips, accentuating the graceful curve of her waist. The material clings to her like a second skin, highlighting the perfect swell of her hips and the enticing space between her thighs.
 
‘Happy?’ she asks.
 
‘Shut the fuck up.’ I make sure to spit the words out. I don’t want any of her backchat. I am sick of women thinking that can get the better of me.
 
‘The bra,’ I say.
 
This time she doesn’t hesitate. She holds eye contact and reaches behind her back to unclip the bra. She moves her hands to her front and allows the bra to fall away.
 
She has amazing tits. They are almost round, her nipples darker but perfectly symmetrical; they poke forward, begging to be sucked. They are perfect, the surgeon my father paid for is an artist, and I am a fan of his work.
 
As she moves a little, I see her breasts sway slightly, and it sparks a new fire for some reason. My cock is pushing against my boxers. I can feel the pre-cum, smudging against the material.
 
I take a moment to admire her body as she stands in the hallway of my father’s house, under my control, eager to please like the little slut she is. Though I have nothing against sluts, some of my best fucks were sluts through and through.
 
‘Knickers,’ I say.
 
This time she breaks eye contact, looking down as she pulls the delicate material from her body, slipping them down her legs and stepping out of them one foot at a time. She lets them drop and looks back at me. I smile and look down at her body; knowing she is watching me, I linger on her pussy. She is smooth, and freshly waxed, and her soft pink skin makes me harder.
 
‘Open your legs wider.’
 
She moves her legs a bit wider; I see the folds of her pussy pull open a little. I can swear she’s wet. I look back to her eyes and smile.
 
‘Lay down,’ I say.
 
‘What here?’ Her voice is harsh. ‘One the floor?’
 
‘Yes, bitch, lay down on the fucking rug right there.’ I point to the center of the rug, just a few feet from us. I take a few steps back to stand on the edge of the rug. She looks up at me and back to the rug. ‘What are you waiting for, Bianca? My father will be home soon. You think he wants to find his whore wife naked before his son?’
 
Bianca sighs. ‘You can be a right asshole sometimes.’
 
‘Shut the fuck up and do it, Bianca. Lay down on the rug, open your legs and expose yourself to me.’
 
Bianca gives the smallest of shrugs. She steps forward and couches onto the rug. I watch her naked body as she positions herself. Her round breasts jiggle with her body movement, and I find this more exciting than before. I’ve seen her naked countless times. I have licked and fucked just about every part of her body. We have been screwing from before she was married, but this time it's different. At the start, it was her that was making all the moves. Now, I want her to submit to me, to understand I am the real boss.
 
She lays on her back, her legs facing me. Her hair sprays out on the carpet, and she is suddenly framed like some cheap Pre-Raphaelite reproduction from Ikea. Blonde, not red, of course. Her legs are pushed together. I step forward so I am standing over her. Our feet are just a few inches apart.
 
‘Open your legs.’
 
She hesitates for a moment and then opens her legs. It is not as far as I would like, but her bald pussy is exposed; I see it better, but I want more. I want her to be fully exposed, open to me, wanting my cock.
 
‘Wider,’ I say.
 
There’s a moment's pause, but she opens her legs wider. Her pussy is now fully in view; her legs are stretched so it is pulling her flaps open. I can see she is wet. Her juices coat her skin. What a fucking whore.
 
I step forward so I am standing between her legs. She looks up at me, spread-eagled, open and wanting. She has a quizzical look on her face. This is new for both of us. I move my hand and unzip the fly of my trousers. I can feel my rock-hard cock pushing against the material. I push my hand into the zip, pull down my boxers and hook out my penis. I stand for a moment, towering over her cock in hand. I know I am big and I know she can see.
 
‘Do you want this?’ I say.
 
‘Yes,’ she replies, a smile flashing across her face.
 
‘Of course, you do.’
 
I look her in the eyes and start stroking my hard cock. I see her look at my hand. She is transfixed. She wants me so much. I glance at her exposed pussy, the pink lips glisten with her juices.
 
I stroke harder, the passion building. I can feel the pleasure start to flood my body. I look down; she is there, legs open, tits on show, pussy begging. She is mine.
 
I feel the climax start to build. I stroke faster, and as the climax peaks, I stop.
 
‘Fuck.’ The word escapes from my lips.
 
Sperm explodes. It sprays out and showers Bianca. I watch as the thick white globules splash onto her legs and pussy. She lets out a little cry of suprise. I step forward, my legs straddling her body and cum again. This time, the sperm splashes onto her tits. I see one lump land on her cheek. She flinches a little.
 
I let my orgasm pass and push my cock back into my shorts.
 
I look down to see Bianca still on her back but now painted with my white cum. It has formed little puddles on her legs, pussy and belly. Some more has crept to her fake tits and face.
 
‘What the fuck Luca?’
 
I smile, a little chuckle, asking my lips. ‘I am a modern-day John Millais.’
 
‘What are you talking about?’ she says, wiping cum from her cheek with the back of her hand. ‘Who is John Mills?’
 
‘Millais.’ I shake my head. ‘Now, clean yourself up; my father will be home soon.’
 
I turn and leave, my footsteps echoing off the wooden flooring.

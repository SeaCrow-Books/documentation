## Luca
 
The evening light fades behind the opaque blinds of my study, painting my world in somber hues of dusk. Mahogany bookshelves line the walls, each one bursting with volumes of literature, legal tomes, and historical accounts – the collected wisdom of generations at my fingertips. A plush, oversized armchair upholstered in aged burgundy leather sits to one side, my preferred spot for reading when time allows. On the opposite side of the room, an abstract painting, bold in colors, adds a modern touch to the otherwise traditional room. A polished mahogany desk commands the center of the room, my laptop perched atop it. My fingers tap on the keys, the soft clicking sound slicing through the thick silence of the room. The monotonous dance is broken by the unanticipated trill of the doorbell echoing through the hallway. I push away from the desk.
 
Padding my way to the hallway, I move amidst a gallery of art pieces, each holding their unique story. The walls are adorned with an eclectic collection of paintings. The cool marble floor feels soothing against my bare feet as I approach the entrance, the intricate patterns of white and gold snaking beneath my steps. I reach out, turning the brass handle of the heavy door, bracing myself for whatever - or whoever - the night has decided to send my way.
 
The heavy wooden door creaks open, revealing the figure of my father standing on the threshold. He is a portrait of a man in the twilight of his life, his glory days well behind him. Once a striking man in his prime, time has been an unforgiving artist, sketching lines of age, worry, and excess onto his once handsome features. His hair, a diluted shade of its former dark vitality, is carefully combed over to disguise the inevitable victory of time. The top has started thinning, leaving only wisps he artfully arranges each morning. It's a futile defiance against age, but I suppose we all have our vanities. His face carries the bloated puffiness of years of heavy drinking, a canvas of late nights and overindulgences. It's a stark contrast to his youth's lean, sharp features, the transformation from striking to hard-lived, both fascinating and a little sad. Once muscular and taut, his body is now thickened by years of rich food and abundant wine, the once athletic build buried under a layer of comfortable living. Despite the decline in his physical shape, there's a strange resilience in him, a defiance that refuses to bow to age.
 
He adorns himself in finely tailored suits, the fabric rich, the cut flattering his stocky frame. His ties are made of silk, their colours complementing his outfits. His shoes are polished leather, their gleam a testament to meticulous care. Every detail of his attire is scrutinized, each wrinkle ironed out, each button in its place. It's a routine as ingrained in him as his morning shave.
 
What strikes me most are his hands. They are large and battered, a map of scars and callouses. Knuckles bulged from years of brawls, fingers branded by remnants of injuries that never quite healed right. They are hands that have known violence, dealt punishment, and protected what he deems his. They're a brutal reminder of our family's legacy and the dark, unforgiving world we hail from.

"Father," I say. "Come in." I motion, stepping aside to let him cross the threshold. His once powerful stride has diminished into a slower, more measured gait, but a lingering air of authority still clings to him, much like the expensive cologne he wears.
 
Leading the way, I guide him through the richly adorned hallway. As we traverse the familiar path towards the kitchen, I can't help but feel a strange anticipation knotting in my stomach. It's an unusual time for my father to pay a visit. His days are usually filled with his enterprises, and Vittorio's unpredictable visit often signals something significant.
 
Once inside the kitchen, I gesture to one of the stools at the counter.
 
"Drink?" I ask.
 
"No, thank you, Luca." His voice is gruff, lined with a lifetime of smoking and shouting orders. He declines the stool, opting to remain standing, his hands resting on the counter's cool surface. "I won't be long."
 
That statement hangs in the air between us, the implication clear. This isn't a social visit. This isn't a father stopping by to chat with his son. This is Vittorio Vella, head of the family, coming to deliver a message.
 
"I wanted to talk face to face," he adds his eyes, the same deep brown as mine, meeting my gaze. There's a hardness there, a seriousness that echoes in his words and makes the apprehension in my gut coil tighter. “It's about the meeting tomorrow. I wanted to chat with Rico and Bianca getting involved.”
 
"Alright," I respond, mirroring his seriousness. I lean against the opposite counter, arms folded, focusing on my father.
 
Vittorio's dark gaze never leaves mine, a glimmer of something unreadable in his eyes. "I don't trust this new woman," he starts, his voice dipped in the rawest form of honesty. "There’s something fishy about the whole set.” He pauses and lets out a long breath. “But we don't have the luxury of choice right now."
 
I nod. "I agree," I respond. "We need to be vigilant. More so now than ever. Until we meet her, its hard to tell anything. I know you have done the research, but until you look eye to eye…" I let my sentence go unfinished.
 
Vittorio looks at me, his gaze as penetrating as an x-ray. "Which is why," he continues, his words slow and measured, "I have decided to keep her close. Close enough that we can monitor her every move."
 
A shrewd move. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. He has always been a master tactician. His decision doesn't surprise me. "Makes sense," I respond, my face a mask of neutrality. “What did you have in mind?”

I think I see a spark of satisfaction flicker in his eyes, but he doesn't pause for congratulations. "Good, I am glad you agree," he affirms. "So she'll be moving in with you, Luca."
 
My world tilts. I blink, processing the words. "Moving in...with me?" I repeat, needing confirmation that I heard him correctly.
 
"Yes," he nods.
 
"Wait a minute. Moving in with me? That's impossible," I protest, incredulity pouring into my words. "I have a life. I can't be expected to babysit some rich, spoiled brat. This isn't a damned daycare."
 
My father's stern gaze hardens, and his jaw sets in a familiar way, a sure sign he isn't backing down. "This isn't up for debate, Luca," he cuts me off, his voice as firm and immovable as a mountain.
 
My frustration swells, fuelled by the audacity of the situation. "Why not Rico, then?" I snap, my hands flailing in emphasis. "Why not task him with this glorified babysitting role?"
 
There's a pause, a silence that amplifies the refrigerator's humming and the clock's distant ticking. My father’s eyes never waver from mine, a hardness settling within them. "Because he’s Rico. He’s great in a touch space, but he’s hardly the man to make a sophisticated woman feel at ease, is he?”
 
I take a breath. He’s right. Rico is loyal, but he’s never been comfortable with a woman. He can face down a murderous thug but ask him to talk to a pretty woman, and he tongue-tied in second. Plus, his history isn’t great with women, and that’s an understatement. And I am sure that if he was locked away with a Russian mafia bitch, he’d drive her insane or bury her in the garden. If my father’s plan is going to work, then we’ll need to build her trust and that’s certainly not a job for Rico.
 
I nod. “No, you are right. I’d not wish Rico on her.”
 
My father looks at me. “Plus, Luca, you're the only person I trust."
 
The room feels suddenly still, even as my pulse picks up pace. I watch my father, a man of few words and even fewer sentiments, admitting to a reliance that weighs more than any responsibility he's ever assigned me. My mouth goes dry, a whirl of emotions twisting within me: resentment, frustration, confusion, and a hint of pride somewhere in place. I swallow hard, meeting his gaze with a determination that mirrors mine.
 
"Alright," I relent, my voice hoarse but resolute. "She can move in."
"So, it's decided. You'll inform her at the meeting tomorrow," he states, laying down the law as only he can. There's no room for argument, no space for negotiation. I nod in reluctant acceptance; my words swallowed up by the bitterness of the situation.
 
With a final lingering glance, my father strides towards the front door, leaving me alone with my turmoil. The door closes with a decisive click, marking the end of the discussion and the beginning of a new chapter of my life.
 
The house settles into silence, amplifying the whirlwind of thoughts within my head. I can't help but resent this assignment I've been saddled with. I crave power, influence, and control, yet here I am, reduced to a chaperone for a trust-fund heiress. The irony is bitter and biting.
 
Despite my father's insistence that this is an opportunity to impress, to prove myself, I can't shake off the feeling of being isolated from the gang, a lone wolf left to wander the outskirts of our empire.
 
For as long as I can remember, my life has been a constant battle for approval, a relentless pursuit of impressing my father. I often felt he preferred Rico. He’s a man he can relate to, simple pleasures and understandable actions. It's a feeling that's clung to me since childhood, that insatiable hunger for recognition, for validation. And despite all I've achieved, it never seems enough. I am always the dutiful son, the loyal lieutenant, but never the leader I yearn to be.
 
I stand in the middle of my luxurious kitchen, the state-of-the-art appliances and the sleek marble countertops, mere reminders of my superficial success. But what about the true power I seek? When does that come into play?
 
But as much as I yearn to break free, a part of me can't help but strive to live up to my father’s expectations. It's a tug-of-war, a constant battle within me. I yearn for more power but feel compelled to please my father, a sentiment that's rooted deep within me.
 
As the silence stretches on, I realize that this situation, as infuriating as it is, could be an opportunity. A chance to prove my mettle, to show my father that I can handle more than just our traditional operations.
 
This woman might be a problem, a complication in my well-structured life, but she could also be a means to an end. A stepping stone to the power and influence I've always craved.
 
The prospect is enticing, the challenge intriguing. And if there's one thing I've never shied away from, it's a challenge. So, I'll take this on, just like I've taken on everything else that's come my way. I'll show my father, show them all, that Luca Vella is more than just a dutiful son. I'm a force to be reckoned with.

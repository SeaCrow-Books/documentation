## Bella
 
I am staring at the door, hefty and seemingly impenetrable. To the side, a barely noticeable security panel proves we're not stuck in some past era.I plop my black backpack down, unzipping it to reveal the precious cargo: my laptop. A strange cocktail of excitement and dread zips through my veins as I pull out the machine, fingers humming with anticipation. Its screen blinks to life, bathing my face in a ghostly glow.
 
Luca's a phantom in the shadows not far off; his shape shrouded in the dim night. He's coiled tight, a spring ready to snap at a moment's notice. I can feel his tension prickling the air as he stands guard, eyes skimming the area for the slightest inkling of trouble.
 
All my focus hones in on the task at hand, adrenaline my fuel, the relentless pull of this thrilling heist my north star. There's no U-turn on this road; I need to be fast, and I need to be accurate. One wrong move and we're toast. The hacking begins, and it's all a charade. This alarm should be asleep, and the door, ready to swing open. But a flutter of doubt sneaks in. The superintendent guaranteed this would go off without a hitch, yet the Universe has a way of spitting on guarantees. I play my part, fingers putting on an intricate ballet across the keyboard. I sense Luca watching, his faith in my skills hanging in the balance.
 
The seconds stretch into a painfully slow eternity. With bated breath, I wait for the signs: alarm silenced, door ready to yield. If the boss's assurance proves hollow, we'll be facing a hot mess with a thin chance of slipping away. The stakes, they've never been this towering, our success teetering on this knife-edge. A wash of relief sweeps over me as the software flickers green, the hacked system giving us the green light.
 
"We're in," I murmur to Luca, attempting to keep the tremor out of my voice.
 
I stand in front of the door's keypad, my fingers poised to tap out the code. Then it hits me like a runaway train—I don't know the damn code. Panic grips me and I falter, stuck in a sticky pool of uncertainty.
 
Luca spots my hesitation. "Everything alright, Bella?"
 
I aim for confidence. "Yeah, I'm good. Just need a moment. I err… reset the system. I just need it to come back online."
 
“Oh, ok,” he says.
 
Desperation kicks my brain into overdrive, searching for a code that the boss might've slipped me. The weight of our mission presses down on me, urging me to sort this out pronto or risk drawing attention. The realization hits—the alarm is off, the door, unsealed. With a random string of numbers punched in, I give the handle a go. It swings open. I pause, ears straining for the shrill wail of an alarm.
 
A smile dances across Luca's face. "Looks like the alarm's out, well done, Baboon."
 
I grin, tension fizzling out. "That nickname's not sticking around."
 
“Not your choice,” he says.
 
We both whip out our flashlights, piercing the inky blackness. The beams of our lights dissect the dark, revealing the lean, no-nonsense pathway ahead. Its floor is of simple, weathered stone tiles designed to bear the brunt of working boots and heavy gear. The walls, dressed in neutral paint, are devoid of embellishments or art. A place of pure function, it strikes a stark contrast with the lavish grandeur we know awaits in the primary living spaces. Stepping into the austere corridor, we halt, our ears pricking up for any sounds—a giveaway shuffle or voices—that might hint at company. Nothing but our breaths punctuating the silence, the distant tick-tock of a clock on the wall. Assured of our solitude, we tread towards the dining room, our steps whispering across the hard tiles.
 
As we snake through the dimly lit corridors, a whirlwind of dread and thrill churns within me. We weave our way through the labyrinth until we stand before the grand ballroom's entrance. Despite our prior visits, the room transforms into a chilling spectacle under the blanket of night, our flashlights offering tantalizing peeks at its majesty.
 
The towering ceilings intimidate us, their intricate plasterwork casting ominous shadows as our lights dance over them. The chandelier, usually ablaze with light, now looms like a sparkling, dormant arachnid, its crystals bouncing off feeble specks of light from our torches. The vast windows, shrouded by thick curtains, hold the moonlight at bay, submerging the room in near-impenetrable darkness. The burnished wooden floor only reveals itself in fragments, gleaming under the sporadic light of our torches. The walls, decked with refined damask wallpaper, feel as if they're closing in on us as we traverse the room, alert for any obstructions or indications of movement.
 
Advancing through the ballroom, I find my mind painting a picture of the room filled to the brim with elegantly dressed people, the air buzzing with laughter and harmonious music. It's a far cry from the silent, deserted expanse we currently navigate, a place that intertwines intimidating beauty and looming threat as we press on with our covert operation. We draw closer to the painting. The room's grandeur instills a sense of awe in me, even though our limited torchlight only uncovers bits and pieces. The room's luxurious essence is evident in the towering ceilings, complex moldings, and elaborate chandeliers. But my focus snaps to the artwork, noting the conspicuous absence of security beams or apparent protection.
 
Even though relief washes over me, I must maintain the illusion of deactivating a security system. I retrieve my laptop and launch the fake program. The screen comes alive with lines of cryptic code, complex algorithms, and commands churning together. I glance covertly at Luca, checking if my performance holds up, and find him observing with evident trust in my abilities. As the program edges towards completion, anticipation and apprehension thread through me. I know the beams should be inactive, but an undercurrent of doubt persists. The program eventually flashes green, signifying the 'deactivation' of the security system. A sigh—part relief, part performance—escapes me, and I swivel toward Luca.
 
"All clear," I declare, injecting confidence into my voice.
 
Luca nods, his eyes mirroring resolute determination, and we inch toward the painting, ready to implement the next phase of our strategy.
 
Luca's flashlight sweeps across the dim room, highlighting an aged wooden chair hiding in a murky corner. The intricate carvings etched onto the chair appear to narrate an untold tale, but we have no time to appreciate its artistry. He strides over, his footfalls bouncing off the expansive room, and retrieves the chair, bringing it back to the painting. Luca adjusts the chair in front of the piece of art, ensuring it's steady on the antiquated, gleaming wooden floor. As he does this, I see sweat starting to dot his forehead - a clear indication of the enormity of what we're doing. He pulls out a small, slim blade from his pocket, incredibly sharp and ideal for the delicate task ahead. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Luca mounts the chair, casting an elongated, misshapen shadow on the wall behind. He lifts the knife and starts to excise the painting from its decorative frame. The blade cuts smoothly, almost seamlessly through the canvas, under the control of Luca's firm, practiced hand.
 
As I observe his work, my thoughts meander to the desecration we'd be committing if this were, in fact, the original painting. This magnificent work of art, steeped in history and culture, would be permanently defaced by our actions. The sound of the knife severing the canvas reverberates through the room, fostering a sense of disquiet that lingers in the air. Tension fills the room, and I find myself holding my breath, my heart thumping wildly in my chest. My gaze remains on Luca and the painting, ready to spring into action at the slightest hint of trouble.
 
Luca makes his final cut with precision, and the severed canvas is removed from its frame. Stepping down from the chair, I can see the relief washing over his face, a sentiment mirrored by my own. Luca rolls the canvas and tucks it into the black bag, ensuring it's secure and safe from harm. As he zips the bag shut, I can feel the adrenaline coursing through us both, the magnitude of our actions sinking in.
 
Luca takes the walkie-talkie, pressing the transmit button, his voice steady amidst the heightened tension. "Eagle, this is Falcon. The nest is empty. Over."
 
A brief spell of static follows before Rico's voice responds through the speaker. "Understood, Falcon. We'll be ready at the rendezvous point. Over and out."
 
“The nest is empty?” I ask, with a hint of a smile.
 
Luca turns towards me, grinning. “It's pro talk.”
 
Shaking my head, I realize we've secured the painting and must hurry. Each moment we linger heightens the risk of detection, so we double back, our flashlights lighting the way through the mansion's darkened corridors. Our hearts pound in sync as we return to the side door we initially entered, the weight of the situation pressing upon us. Emerging into the chill night air, we leave the tense atmosphere of the mansion behind. The cloak of darkness shrouds us, shielding us from any onlookers as we retrace our path to the wall we scaled earlier. Eventually, we reach our vehicle, tucked away in a discreet lane.
 
As we head towards the car, the weight of the text message I received earlier resurfaces. The intensity of the heist had allowed me to momentarily forget, but now, with the painting secured and our escape in progress, the gravity of my situation dawns on me. For the police sting to work, the painting needs to get to Vittorio, but the threat in the anonymous message looms ominously. If Vittorio discovers I'm undercover, my life will be forfeit. Unaware of my inner turmoil, Luca focuses on our escape. I'm consumed by guilt for roping him into this, given his unwavering support and kindness. Torn between my duty and loyalty, I realize a decision needs to be made.
 
We reach the car, our breath frosting in the cold night air, hearts still pounding from the adrenaline rush. Luca opens the door for me, and I slide into the passenger seat, the cool leather against my skin a sharp contrast. He shuts the door and moves to the driver's side, his actions swift and efficient.
 
Luca reaches for the ignition.
 
"Hold on," I say.
 
His gaze turns towards me, filled with confusion and worry. The soft illumination from the dashboard highlights his striking features, causing my heart to flutter. I can't ignore the emotions that have blossomed between us, intensified by the shared adventures and dangers.
 
"There's something I need to tell you," I muster the courage to say.

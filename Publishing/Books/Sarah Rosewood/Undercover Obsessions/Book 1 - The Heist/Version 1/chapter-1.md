## Bella
 
As I stepped into the forbidding edifice, my footfalls reverberated against the cold, rigid floor. The structure, a testament to the unyielding 1950s brutalist architecture, mirrored the somber undertone of the tasks executed within. The stark white walls stood erect, towering towards the high ceilings, their austerity unrelenting.
 
This place always made me feel like I stuck out. My street clothes, faded jeans and a loose black hoodie, formed a vivid contrast against the sea of blue uniforms. Life hummed around me; officers engrossed in their duties, some huddled in clusters amidst animated discussions, others absorbed in a deluge of paperwork. Others would stop and stare as I walked past, their intense eyes watching as I passed through their small section of the world. I want to pretend that I hated this, but something about their attention always sent a slight tingle of excitement.
 
The labyrinthine corridors eventually led me to a solid wooden door. The name 'Superintendent Harrison' gleamed on the metallic nameplate. An uneasy knot tightened in my stomach. A summons to Harrison's office was not commonplace. It suggested either a severe misstep on my part or a monumental task at hand. Swallowing the rising tide of anxiety, I took a deep breath. I was a professional. Whatever the challenge, it had to outweigh my apprehensions.
 
I knocked on the door and waited.
 
“Enter.” The voice was muffled. I pushed open the door at his call.
 
Harrison sat amidst the organized chaos of his desk, a symbol of his long history in this job. Towering stacks of paperwork, a testament to countless solved cases, took up much of the surface. Amidst this mess sat a decades-old desk lamp, light harsh and unflinching, and a coffee-stained mug. The scattered photographs showed a younger Harrison, a more innocent time with a fiery spark in his eyes. Sitting behind the desk, the man looked at ease yet stressed. Greying hair combed back, lines etched deeply on his face from years of late-night stakeouts and relentless investigations. His stormy blue-grey eyes held a glimmer of the past but carried the weight of countless experiences. He looked up and motioned for me to sit. Despite the strain visible on his face, he smiled.
 
"Good to see you, Bella. You're looking well. Everything okay at home?"
 
I nodded. "I'm good, thank you.”
 
He paused. We sat, the sounds of the building’s activity floating muffled through the door. “I spoke to your mother a few weeks ago.” He took a long breath. “She seems… ok.” It was like he was searching for the right words.
 
“Yeah,” I said. “She likes her new place.” I let the silence fill the room for a moment. “Superintendent, I'm eager to know why I'm here. What's the urgent matter?" I keep my tone professional.
 
“All business as always,” he said with a smile.
 
Harrison reclines in his chair, his fingers woven together. "Bella," he started, his eyes intent on me, "do you recall Van Gogh's painting, The Poppy Flowers?"
 
The mention of the artwork takes me by surprise, but I wracked my brain for art history tidbits. My art history education suddenly becoming relevant. "Yes," I answered. "It was stolen, right?"
 
A nod confirmed my recollection. Harrison's fingers tapped a silent rhythm on the desk, filling the silence as he spoke. "Twice, actually. Both times from a museum in Cairo. The first theft was in 1977 but was recovered ten years later. The second time it disappeared was in 2010."
 
My eyebrows knitted together in confusion. "Why does this stolen painting matter to us now, sir? Do you have a lead?"
 
Harrison leaned forward. "Six months ago, an anonymous tip-off reached us. A British aristocrat claimed to know where the painting was located. He expressed interest in buying and donating the artwork to the National Gallery. Not sure why he was overcome with national pride, though it sounds more like guilt to me. However, he added a condition – he doesn't want to be prosecuted for theft or handling stolen goods. He’s not admitting any wrongdoing; he just doesn’t fancy a stint in jail for doing what he sees as his patriotic duty. We don’t think he’s the thief anyway, just a middleman. Anyway, he’s got links high up in the Government and pots of cash; we’d never get a conviction to stick, even if we wanted to."
 
My eyebrows shot up as the unexpected twist took a moment to register. "And we agreed to that?"
 
A nod from Harrison confirmed it. His face was stern. "We made a deal. Nothing to lose. It's a win-win. He gets the good press; we recover a stolen work of art."
 
“What kind of deal?”
 
Leaning back into his chair, Harrison's arms folded across his chest. "Ever heard of the Vella gang?" His question hung in the air, punctuated by the ticking of the wall clock.
 
I shook my head. "No, I can't say I have. Should I?"
 
"No, there’s no reason you would have. The Vellas are a small family gang, but don't let that fool you. They're mostly into art crime. They've been on our radar for several years now. We suspect them of being involved in major thefts, but we've never been able to pin anything on them. They are very careful." Harrison had a grave tone as he talked, a hint of worry barely discernible beneath the seasoned calm.
 
I sat on the edge of my seat. "Tell me more. Who's in charge?"
 
"The boss is a man named Vittorio Vella, originally from Sicily," Harrison explained. "There are rumors of connections, both in Sicily and here. He’s probably mafia, or at the very least, under mafia protection. He's a tough one, not easily swayed or intimidated. He is the kind of guy that you need to tread carefully around. Expensive lawyers back him, so any case against him must be airtight. He’s very hard to pin down."
 
I could feel the implications of Harrison's words starting to settle in.
 
"And there's more," Harrison continued, gazing at me. "His son, Luca, is also heavily involved in the gang's activities. He seems to be more of the brains behind the operation. A few years ago, there were rumors that he was looking to branch out into cybercrime, but nothing came of it." Harrison leaned back in his chair. "We've been working on building a case against the Vellas for years," he began, his gaze piercing. "If I am honest, it's become a bit of a pet project of mine. I’ve been watching Vittorio for as long as I can remember. He’s slipped through my hands a few times. As retirement looms, it suddenly becomes important to me that I get this scumbag behind bars.”  He stops and looks up, an expression on his face as though he’s said too much. “Well, anyway, we now finally have a plan in place."
 
“Go on.”
 
"The generous aristocrat has agreed to display the 'missing' Van Gogh in his mansion," he explained, making air quotes around 'missing'. "Of course, he'll display an impressively accurate forgery. This has taken a long time to implement; we’ve had a forger working on the painting for months. A guy called John Myatt.”
 
My eyebrows shoot up. “Ohh, I’ve met him.”
 
“Really?”
 
“Yeah, a few years ago. He was part of a job, he helped to identify a forgery. A family thought they had an original Paul Gauguin; Myatt was part of the team that proved it was a fake.”
 
Harrison smiled. “Yes, I remember now. Not one of mine, though. Anyway, this time, we are dealing with an original, but it is already safe in the vaults of the National Gallary in London. Myatt’s setup is impressive. Trust me; this fake is convincing. It will stand up to a casual inspection, even from an expert."
 
His words sparked a mixture of intrigue and excitement within me.
 
"That's not all," Harrison said, and there was a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. "About six weeks ago, one of our undercover officers approached Vittorio. He was posing as a Russian mafia boss interested in European art. The Vella gang has a reputation, so this wasn’t anything unusual. Our guy explained that they had learned about the Van Gough coming out of hiding and where it was to be displayed.”
 
“Clever,” I say.
 
“Yeah, I thought so too. Our guy explained to Vittorio that it was unsafe for the Russians to come to Britain with the current political climate. They would be watched from the border and this was no way to snatch a famous painting. He told Vittorio that he had heard of his previous work and wanted to bankroll him to steal the painting. The deal was that the Vella gang would grab the painting and then sell it back to the Russians at a price lower than the black market value. Our guy laid it on heavy, telling Vittorio he was the only person that could do the job. Appealed directly to his vanity. Vittorio fell for it. The Russians would fund the operation in return for a knockdown price. Win-win."
 
Hearing this, I couldn't help but admire the audacity of the plan. It was playing right into Vittorio's ego, and the promise of a hefty profit would be too tempting for him to resist. Stealing a famous painting was often the easy part of the deal; finding a buyer for such a unique item was the real skill. It wasn’t a surprise that Vittrio couldn’t resist.
 
"They have already agreed on a price, and the theft is set to take place in the coming weeks," Harrison finished, satisfaction evident in his voice.
 
"And where do I fit into all of this?"
 
Harrison's gaze was steady on me. "We need someone on the inside. Someone to ensure that evidence is gathered properly and everything goes according to plan. I can't risk this being another botched job and Vittorio getting off on a technicality." I nodded. "Our Russian mafia boss insisted that he would only fund the theft if one of his 'security experts' were involved in the operation," he continued, using air quotes again. "Vittorio was hesitant initially, but when the Russian threatened to pull out of the deal, he reluctantly agreed."
 
Confusion furrowed my brows as I considered Harrison's plan. "But I don't speak Russian, and I certainly don't have a Russian accent," I pointed out, the concern evident in my voice.
 
Harrison chuckled. "Your backstory will be that you grew up in London after the fall of Communism. You are a brat from money. You have never set foot in Russia and saw more of your nannies than your Commie relatives. Your father was a part of the Russian mafia, and you're a whizz with technology and alarm systems."
 
I let out a soft laugh, shaking my head in disbelief. "But I barely know anything about tech," I admitted, running a hand through my hair. The idea of posing as a tech expert was daunting.
 
"That won't be a problem, the Vella gang don’t know anything about this stuff either," Harrison assured me. "We'll provide you with a laptop full of fake tech. We have had a real security expert working on creating the software for the past few weeks. Remember, the theft will be staged, so all the alarm and security systems will be fake. They'll be disabled on the day of the operation. You will just need to hit a button, the software with bump and flash and it will look like you worked some hacking magic. We’ve done this before; it's very effective."
 
His words did nothing to quell my anxiety. Despite his assurances, I couldn't shake off the nagging worries. The plan seemed too convoluted, too fraught with risks.
 
"Trust me, Bella, we've thought of everything. All you have to do is play your part convincingly."
 
His words were meant to be comforting but did little to quell my stomach's knot of unease tightening. It was one thing to be told everything was under control and another to believe it fully. Despite my reservations, I knew I had no choice but to trust Harrison and hope his plan worked as smoothly as he believed it would.
 
Harrison rummaged through one of the desk drawers, emerging with a small thumb drive. He extended it towards me, the tiny piece of tech glistening under the harsh office light. "Everything you need is on this," he stated. "Go home and study the information."
 
I take the thumb drive from him, turning it over in my fingers, its weight barely noticeable. Suddenly, the room feels incredibly small, the enormity of the task pressing in on me from all sides. I look up at Harrison, my voice barely above a whisper. "How long do I have?"
 
"A few days, at least, perhaps a week," he replies, a hint of sympathy in his eyes. “There are still a few things that need to be put in place, but be ready to go.”
 
A few days to become a Russian mafia boss's daughter and a tech expert. A few days to prepare to infiltrate a notorious art crime gang. A daunting task indeed, but it was my job. The job I had signed up for, and despite the nerves and the fear, I knew I had to see it through.
 
"It's not all bad,” he said with a smile. “We've booked you a five-star hotel in the city center. You'll live the high life, just as a Russian mafia boss's daughter would." He pauses for a moment, giving me a significant look. "This is where you'll be based while the robbery is organized, and it's also the first step in selling your cover story to the Vellas."
 
The news of a luxurious hotel stay does nothing to diminish my overwhelming responsibility, but I give Harrison a determined nod. I must focus on what's important - maintaining my cover and gathering evidence against the Vella gang. The comforts of the hotel room would be just that - comforts, not distractions. "I understand, superintendent," I affirm, the grip on my resolve tightening. "I won't disappoint.”
 
Harrison's gaze found mine again, his voice taking on a somber tone that made my heart clench. "Bella," he began, his stern eyes not leaving mine. "This job is more dangerous than any you've taken on before." The gravity of his words hung between us, leaving no room for doubt. He leaned forward in his chair, creating a connection that felt almost tangible in its intensity. "The Vella gang... they're not just petty criminals. We believe they're killers.” He pauses as if contemplating what to tell me. “I am convinced he’s a killer. Vittorio’s wife disappeared under mysterious circumstances some years ago. It was investigated at the time. I was on the case, just a sergeant. It was the first time I crossed paths with Vittorio. We suspected he had killed her, but we had no evidence. She just disappeared. There was never a body. We looked but could never find anything. We even questioned Vittorio, but with nothing but circumstantial evidence, we had to let him go. I can still see the smug bastard’s face as he strutted out of the station. That’s just one example. If they discover your true identity, your life will be in immediate danger."
 
His words echoed in the silence, each feeling like a cold drop of rain, chilling to the bone. Yet, despite the risk, I knew I had a duty to fulfill. I swallowed hard, the risk pressing down on me like a heavy cloak, but my resolve remained unshaken. As I took in Harrison's stark words, I felt a familiar stirring within me, a thrum of adrenaline that quickened my pulse. The thrill of the chase, the allure of danger, was like a siren's song, pulling me in with its intoxicating melody. The thrill-seeker in me reveled in this chaos and thrived on the unpredictability. I've always been one for adventure, drawn to life's wild and uncharted territories. From the moment I'd chosen this career, I'd craved the high stakes, the thrill that came with unraveling mysteries and standing toe-to-toe with danger. This dangerous assignment sang to that part of me and promised an excitement that was rare, even in our line of work. And on top of that, it gave me a chance to put real criminals behind bars and make a difference. This is why I joined up. I had always known the dangers that come with the job. And yet, there was a quieter voice, a small, prudent whisper that nudged at my consciousness. It spoke of caution, of the importance of safety and self-preservation. It painted vivid pictures of worst-case scenarios, each more terrifying than the last. I could end up in a situation far beyond my control. If discovered, I might be at the mercy of ruthless killers. What then? What if my cover was blown? What if I was injured or worse? What would my sacrifice mean, then?
 
Control has always been important to me. I think it’s how I process emotion and keep the dark thoughts at bay. I can’t allow my world to be chaotic; I need to have some level of control. Yet, even I can admit that, at times, this was exhausting, the constant need to keep things from breaking away from me and spiraling out of control.
 
One thing remained clear. I was no stranger to danger nor one to shy away from a challenge. Yes, the risks were real and considerable. But I'd entered this field, eyes wide open, aware that my path was far from the safest. I made a silent pledge to myself - I would face this with courage as I had faced everything else. I would step into the lion's den.
 
Looking Harrison in the eye, I nodded. "I understand, Harrison. But I'm prepared to take that risk."
 
Harrison's eyes carried a deep understanding, bringing an unexpected lump to my throat. "Your father would be proud, Bella," he says, the words striking a chord within me.
 
"I... I believe he would be," I reply, trembling.
 
“I know that you have never really got over his murder, but there was nothing you could have done. You were only a kid.”
 
“I know,” I say. I pause, feeling the tears well up. “He knew the risks.”
 
“But I understand,” the superintendent says. “You might not be able to get justice for his murder, but this helps in its small way. I get it. This work is important to you. It's why I suggested you for this case; the fact you have a master’s in fine art did help, though.” He smiles, but it soon falls away.
 
“Thank you,” I say.
 
“But Bella, you know it will never be enough, right? You know that no matter how many criminals you put behind bars, that need will keep nagging away. It will not bring your father back.”
 
I know he’s right. I know it will never be enough, but I don’t know what else to do.
 
Harrison coughs and looks away. "You need to go upstairs to see Stella," he says. "She has your 'undercover kit' and is expecting you."
 
“I like Stella,” I say with a smile.
s
“We all like Stella,” he says, matching my smile.
 
I stand up, tucking away the thumb drive safely. I nod at Harrison, a silent promise, before stepping out of the office and towards whatever lies ahead.
 
I take a deep breath as I exit the sanctuary of Harrison's office. Walking towards the stairwell, I notice the architectural severity slowly tapering off, replaced by a more lived-in, worn-down feel. In stark contrast to the cold, sterile modernity of the lower floors, this area of the building clings to its past with stubborn tenacity. Once a clinical white, the walls now appear as though they're wearing a patchwork quilt of greying blots and water stains, each marking the passage of time like rings in a tree. The fluorescent lights here are also less imposing. Their illumination is subdued, casting dim light and long shadows that twist and dance along the hallway. This distinct shift from the omnipresent brightness that dominates the lower floors creates a simultaneously comforting and slightly foreboding atmosphere.
 
As I tread the quieter corridors of this upper floor, I pass numerous closed doors. Each one conceals an office or a room behind it; their contents are as mysterious as the person who occupies them. I recognize fewer faces here. The officers and staff I encounter are in their worlds, engrossed in tasks that keep their eyes fixed on screens, papers, or just the worn-out floor tiles beneath their feet. No one stares as I pass. A sense of isolation fills this part of the station - a stark contrast to the hive of activity below.
 
Stella's office was a forgotten nook tucked away in this quiet maze; the office was a testament to organized chaos. Two desks had been crammed into this ungenerous space, both vying for territory amidst a jungle of old files, antiquated computer hardware, and oddball tech gadgets. The chaos was overwhelming, yet there was a strange sense of order. One desk was deserted, its surface a barren landscape in stark contrast to its neighbor.
 
Stella, occupying the other desk, seemed to thrive in the chaos. She was an unassuming woman in her early thirties, almost invisible amidst the office clutter. Her plain, mousy hair was cut in a neat bob, her face perennially framed by a pair of sensible glasses that gave her an air of studious intensity. Dressed in a simple jumper and jeans, she blended into the chaos like a chameleon adapting to her environment. The lack of ostentation didn't make her any less formidable, though. Something was captivating about her, a quiet dedication that seemed to hum around her.
 
The moment Stella spotted me, her face lit up in a warm smile. She rose from her chair and embraced me, her arms welcoming and comforting. We had been through so much together, and every time I saw her, it felt like a homecoming. But as quickly as the warmth had filled the room, it evaporated, replaced by Stella's focused, business-like demeanor.
 
“Bella,” she said, “I have something for you.”
 
She searched around the room, shuffling papers and moving items in her hunt. I watched as she weaved through the chaos of her office with a surety that was both mesmerizing and amusing. After some rifling, she found what she was looking for. An open cardboard box, seemingly nondescript, amidst the clutter surrounding it. A sticky note affixed to the side, bearing the words 'Vella Case' in Stella's neat handwriting, was the only clue of its importance. Stella retrieved a thick manila folder from the box, noticeably bulging with documents. She handed it over to me.
 
"These are the hard copies of all the digital information Harrison should have given you. Just in case you prefer the old-school method. He gave you a pen drive, right?" I nodded. “Good.”
 
She returned to the box and pulled out a sleek new smartphone and a charger. "This," she said, holding the device up, "has been loaded with all the apps someone in your supposed situation would have. Make sure you take some time to familiarize yourself with them." I nod and take the phone.
 
Stella's hand dove back into the box, her fingers riffling through various contents. From the depths of the box, she pulled out a sleek laptop - a beautiful piece of technology with a gleaming, obsidian surface. Accompanying it was a charger, its black cord coiled thick and robust, hinting at the power that would flow through it.
 
"This," she started, cradling the laptop with almost reverent care, "is your key to success." The lights overhead cast reflective streaks across the surface of the device, making it shimmer with an air of clandestine sophistication. "Our resident tech wizard, Dave, from IT, has loaded it with all the software you could need." She placed the laptop in my hands. "You'll have a video chat with him later and he'll go through everything in detail. Make sure you know how to navigate the labyrinth of digital deception we've installed there."
 
The last item she retrieved from the box seemed nondescript at first glance - a small, simple, black object. But I knew better. It was a burner phone, small enough to fit into the palm of my hand, yet I could sense its heavy implications.
 
"And this, Bella," Stella's voice was uncharacteristically grave, her gaze sharp and piercing, "is your lifeline in the abyss." The tiny phone felt like it weighed a ton as I accepted it from her, the sheer magnitude of its purpose dawning on me. "It's got a single contact - a quaint Russian restaurant in Soho. If the worst comes to pass, dial the number, request 'the table by the kitchen for 8 p.m.’ and use the name 'Gordievsky.' They are part of our network - they'll connect you to me immediately. Otherwise, it will appear as a mundane dinner reservation. But," she paused, reinforcing the urgency of her words, "this is to be used in dire situations only."
 
Stella confirmed, her eyes sweeping across the empty expanse of the cardboard box that once housed my undercover equipment. "I believe we've covered everything for now, Bella," she remarked, a glint of solemnity replacing the enthusiastic spark in her gaze. She straightened her glasses, her gaze meeting mine. "We'll have a proper sit-down, a thorough catch-up, once this job is over, alright?"
 
Her words carried an undercurrent of promise, a hint of a future where all this cloak-and-dagger business was behind us. I found myself nodding, my agreement automatic, my hands tightening around the sleek contours of the laptop now entrusted to me. As I turned to leave, I cast a backward glance at Stella. She was already swallowed up in the whirlwind of her office, her slender figure becoming almost invisible amongst the haphazard piles of paperwork and tech gadgets. I paused for a fleeting moment, absorbing the surrealism of the situation, before stepping out of her office.

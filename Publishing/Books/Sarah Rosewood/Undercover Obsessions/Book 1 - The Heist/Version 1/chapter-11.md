## Bella
 
As I head down the stairs, I notice Luca in the kitchen, his back to me as he busies himself with making coffee. The morning light filters through the windows, creating a halo effect around him. He's dressed casually in a simple white t-shirt that hugs his muscular back and well-worn jeans that fit him perfectly. The sight of him - so at ease in his own home, absorbed in such a mundane task - is unexpectedly attractive. My heart thrums in my chest, a new awareness of him awakening inside me. I realize I'm viewing Luca in a different light than before. Not as my boss, or as a potential threat, but as a deeply complex and surprisingly gentle man beneath his hardened exterior. His hair, still damp from a shower, is haphazardly tousled, making him look endearingly boyish. I wonder what running my fingers through those dark locks would feel like. The momentary thought startles me, and I quickly push it aside.
 
As he sets it on the countertop, the clink of the coffee mug pulls me from my thoughts. Luca hasn't noticed my presence yet, and I take a moment to observe him, my heart oddly fluttering. I need to remember why I'm here. But as I watch Luca - strong, vulnerable Luca - I'm not entirely sure I can.
 
Memories from last night rush back, filling my thoughts. The softness of his gaze, the way his eyes darkened as he leaned in. His lips, mere inches away from mine before I put a halt to it. And the way my own heart pounded in response, eager for that connection. But I couldn't let that happen. I shouldn't. After that, I spent hours in bed, tossing and turning, my mind restless with questions and confusion. As much as I was drawn to him, I had to remember my place. I was here for a job, not for a romance. I had built a career on being meticulous, on putting feelings aside, focusing on the tasks at hand. I couldn't afford to let emotions get in the way now.
 
But as I stand there, watching him, convincing myself of that is harder than ever. I feel a pull towards him that's almost magnetic, one I can't seem to resist. I shake my head slightly, trying to clear these feelings away. This isn't like me, I'm not the kind of woman who falls for her targets, and I can't start now.
 
I step into the kitchen. Luca spins around; his surprise is evident in the slight widening of his eyes. He clears his throat, trying to find his composure.
 
"Hello, Bella," he greets, a sheepish smile tugging at his lips.
 
I echo his greeting, my voice steady despite the turmoil inside me. "Hello, Luca."
 
The atmosphere is palpably awkward, but we both pretend not to notice. After all, there's no point in acknowledging the elephant in the room if you have no intention of removing it.
 
Luca raises his hands in a defensive gesture, his hazel eyes serious. "Bella, I... I owe you an apology," he stammers, "for last night. It was wrong of me to wake you, to scare you. And what happened... I'm just, I'm really embarrassed."
 
"Luca, it's okay. We all have our moments. I understand."
 
A sense of relief washes over his features as he gives me a small, appreciative smile. "And... about the... the studio. Can you..."
 
I cut him off with a smile. "Keep a secret?" At his nod, I add, "Luca, I'm very good at keeping secrets."
 
His laughter rings out, a rare sound like a melody. For a fleeting moment, I wonder how it would feel to be the constant recipient of that laughter, but I quickly shake the thought away.
 
"Would you like some coffee?" Luca asks, breaking the comfortable silence that had settled between us.
 
I nod. "Yes, please."
 
Just as he's about to reach for the coffee pot, the doorbell rings, filling the quiet house with its echoing chime. A startled expression crosses Luca's face, and he gestures to the coffee pot, indicating he'll be back.
 
"Stay here, I'll get it," he murmurs before disappearing from the kitchen.
 
I'm alone in the middle of the room, listening to the faint sounds of the front door opening. The quiet hum of the house is suddenly broken by a voice I've come to know too well - Vittorio's. His deep, commanding tone sends a shiver of unease down my spine.
 
Luca returns moments later. Behind him Vittorio saunters in his tall and imposing figure seeming to fill the room. He's dressed in a finely tailored dark suit highlighting his frame, a crisp white shirt peeking out from underneath. His greying hair is slicked back, and his piercing blue eyes scan the room. Behind Vittorio, his right-hand man, Bianca, follows a stern expression fixed on her face. Trailing behind the pair is Rico. His shaven head gleams under the overhead light, and his sharp, piercing brown eyes don't miss a thing. He's dressed in his usual casual attire: a t-shirt, jeans, and signature leather jacket. A silver chain glints at his neck, the only hint of extravagance about him.
 
Vittorio is carrying a rectangular parcel wrapped in glossy, cream-colored paper. A thick red ribbon is tied around it in a flawless bow, the ends curling elegantly. He sets the parcel down on the kitchen table with a soft thud, his eyes never leaving me as he does so.
 
Vittorio’s booming voice breaking the tense silence. "I need to take a piss," he declares.
 
I can't help but chuckle at his forthrightness; it's a stark contrast to the serious atmosphere that lingers around Luca.
 
"Use the upstairs bathroom, Vittorio," Luca directs, pointing a thumb over his shoulder. "The one down here is getting fixed."
 
Vittorio grunts in acknowledgment, turning on his heel and heading towards the stairs. As he disappears, Bianca lets out a sigh. “It's his prostrate. He can’t go more than thirty minutes without a visit. He’s off to see the doc next week. I’ve been nagging him for months.”
 
I chuckle again, I find the insight into domestic life amusing, imagining this dangerous gangster getting nagged to see the doctor.
 
The silence descends upon us again. Rico breaks it this time, his gaze darting from Luca to me. "You got the CCTV sorted?" he questions, his tone guarded.
 
Luca grimaces, running a hand through his hair. "Not yet. Bella was going to have a look, but we haven't had the chance," he admits. His gaze lands on me, and I can feel the heat rise to my cheeks.
 
"No worries," Rico responds, shrugging off the inconvenience. "I'll check it out while I'm here."
 
"Thanks, Rico," Luca responds, his tone genuinely appreciative. He watches as Rico makes his way towards the stairs, then turns his attention back to the rest of us in the kitchen.
 
"Is the control box still in the master bedroom?" Rico's voice echoes down from the staircase.
 
"Yeah, same place," Luca confirms, leaning against the kitchen counter. His eyes flicker to me for a moment before returning to the stairs as the thump of Rico's boots fades.
 
Just as the silence is about to settle in again, Vittorio returns from the bathroom, passing Rico on the stairs. His jovial voice fills the room, effectively dispelling the quiet. With a nod to Luca, Rico continues his ascent up the stairs to work on the CCTV.
 
I watch Luca's expression shift as he turns to Vittorio, his eyebrows drawing together. "What's this about? You've come all the way here - it must be important."
 
"There have been developments," he says, his voice carrying an edge of seriousness that is unusual for him.
 
I glance at Luca and see his jaw tighten. He's surprised - and not pleasantly. Something in his face tells me he's not happy about being the last to know. I can't blame him. For someone who prides himself on being in control, the situation must feel like it's slipping out of his grasp.
 
‘What kind of developments?’ Luca asks.
 
‘Well,’ Vittorio says, clearly enjoying the power games, ‘it turns out that there’s going to be a summer ball held at the manor house we are planning to rob. On the face of it, the ball is a fundraising event for some stupid charity the toff runs, but I think it's just a chance for him to show off the Van Gough. All a bit brash.’
 
I am surprised that Luca didn’t know this; it seems like the type of information he would have been told.
 
‘What has this got to do with us?’ I ask.
 
"Well," Vittorio announces, an odd twinkle in his eyes. "Funny you should ask, Bella. I've pulled a few strings and got us a couple of invites. It will be the perfect chance for us to case the place and get a closer look at the painting."
 
Luca interjects, his eyebrows knitting together. "That makes sense, but I wish you had told me about this sooner."
 
"Everything happened very last minute," Vittorio explains, a hint of annoyance in his voice. "The ball is this weekend."
 
"What?" Luca exclaims, his voice echoing off the kitchen tiles. "That's in two days." His shocked expression mirrors my own. Our timeframe just got a whole lot tighter.
 
"I am sure you can handle this, Luca," Vittorio states, his tone laced with confidence that I wish I could share.
 
"Of course we can," Luca responds. "It's just a bit of a shock."
 
"Come on, Luca,” Bianca chimes in, her teasing tone cutting through the heavy air. “I'm sure you're up for this. After all, it gives you and Bella a chance to go on a real date." The smile on her face doesn't quite reach her eyes.
 
Luca gives Bianca a hard stare, but Vittorio laughs, dismissing the tension. "It will be no date, all business."
 
"Of course," I nod in agreement, biting my lower lip to stop the flush of embarrassment.
 
"One last thing," Vittorio says, turning his attention towards me. He gestures to the parcel wrapped in red ribbon. "You can't attend a ball dressed in a hoodie and baseball cap and dressed like a boy. I bought you a present."
 
A present? From Vittorio? This can't be good.
 
I hesitate to open it.
 
“Gone on,” Vittorio says.
 
I look to Luca and he nods.
 
I peel the wrapping paper, revealing a garment bag that houses a dress. It's a black ball gown from the famed designer Alexander McQueen. The dress is simply stunning. Its silhouette is traditional, with a voluminous, floor-length skirt that gives way to a fitted bodice. The bodice is embroidered intricately with tiny crystals, forming a celestial pattern against the dark backdrop. But what stands out most is the back - it's daringly low, allowing a teasing glimpse of skin. I run my fingers across the fabric, feeling the exquisite workmanship. It's a gown made for someone used to the limelight, someone of high society - not someone like me.
 
"I... I can't," I stammer, completely taken aback. "This is too much, Vittorio."
 
"Nonsense," he dismisses my protest. "You will be attending a high society event. You need to fit in, and this," he indicates the gown, "will help you do just that."
 
From the corner of my eye, I see Bianca crossing her arms, a pout forming on her lips. "Why don't you ever buy me clothes, Vittorio?" she complains, a hint of envy in her tone.
 
Vittorio laughs. "Bianca, my dear," he begins, his voice laced with amusement, "your walk-in wardrobe is filled with clothes I've bought for you. You could start your own fashion boutique with all those outfits."
 
Bianca's cheeks turn a slight shade of pink at his statement, and she doesn't retort. Instead, she quiets down, her eyes fixating on the magnificent gown draped across my arms. I can't help but feel a little guilty despite knowing that this is all part of the job.
 
As I lift the dress, I carefully align it with my body, noticing how its dimensions mirror my own. "It looks perfect," I breathe out, a note of surprise coloring my voice. The exquisite design and flawless stitching are more lavish than anything I've ever owned.
 
Luca, who has been uncharacteristically silent, suddenly lets out a snort of laughter. "If there's one thing my father excels at, it's guessing a woman's dress size from ten paces."
 
His comment hangs in the air, a moment of lightness amidst all the tension. But before anyone can respond, the heavy thud of boots descending the stairs draws our attention. Rico appears with a puzzled expression as he takes in the scene. As his gaze lands on the dress clutched in my hands, his eyes widen, and he lets out a low, appreciative whistle.
 
"Bella, is that your dress?" he asks, an undercurrent of respect in his voice. I can't help but blush. I nod. ‘Nice.’
 
Bianca, her eyes still lingering on the dress, looks a touch upset. The usually unflappable woman appears rattled. "I think I've seen enough for now. I need to powder my nose," she announces, her voice slightly shaky.
 
Luca, already looking annoyed with the foot traffic going in and out of his personal space, gives her a pointed look. "Upstairs, Bianca," he reminds her, a little irritation creeping into his tone.
 
Bianca ascends the stairs. Vittorio retakes command of the room, focusing on Luca, Bella, and Rico.
 
"Alright," he starts, his tone authoritative and no-nonsense. "Meeting at two at the warehouse. I’ll make sure it's clear so we can talk in private. We need to plan this weekend's events thoroughly. There's no room for error here. Luca, Bella, Rico - I expect all of you there. Do you understand?"
 
Rico nods, his face set in a serious line. Luca gives a nod of his own, the movement measured and unhurried. "We'll be there," he assures Vittorio, inclining his head towards me.
 
I fold the stunning black gown and tuck it back into its box, my fingers smoothing over the cool, sleek fabric.
 
Vittorio and Rico are heading for the exit, their heavy footfalls echoing in the high-ceilinged kitchen. From the hallway, Vittorio's booming voice ricochets off the walls. "Bianca, hurry up. We're leaving."
 
There's a brief moment of silence, hanging heavy in the air, a quiet before the storm. It's shattered when Bianca appears at the top of the stairs, her face flushed. She doesn't utter a word as she begins her descent, her gaze flickering towards the box in my hands before quickly darting away.
 
Luca takes the lead, guiding the group to the front door. The rhythm of their footsteps fill the hallway, the sound echoing around us in a stark reminder of the ticking clock and the urgency of the situation.
 
With the box securely in my grasp, I leave the now quiet kitchen and begin my ascent up the grand staircase. Each step I take is methodical, my mind swirling with the task ahead and the complexities that come with it. I'm sure I didn't sign up for this level of glamour and deception.
 
I reach the top of the stairs, my attention drawn towards the door to my room, which is slightly ajar. I frown, pausing. I'm almost certain that I had closed it before heading downstairs. But then again, with all the recent commotion, maybe I'm mistaken. Stepping into the room, a feeling of unease sweeps over me. It's a strange sensation, like the quiet hum in your ears when you know something isn't right. I glance around, taking in the familiar sight of the room, but everything seems to be in its rightful place.
 
Shaking off the unsettling feeling, I walk further in, setting the box on the bed. But there it is again, that nagging suspicion that something is off. My gaze flits to the mirror, the only piece of décor in the room I've allowed myself to touch since my arrival. It's off-kilter, angled differently from how I'd left it.
 
I feel the blood rushing to my head, my heartbeat echoing in my ears like a deafening drum as I rush toward the mirror. The room feels smaller, the walls closing in on me, every breath I take sharp and quick, like shards of glass cutting through my lungs. I reach out, my hands trembling, their usually steady grace nowhere to be found. It's as if time has decided to dance to a slower tune, my actions seemingly taking forever.
 
My fingers close around the mirror's edges, the glass's coldness making me wince. I pull it back, the image it reflects distorted by my rapid movements. My eyes scan the usually overlooked space behind it, desperation creeping into every inch of my being.
 
And then I see it, or rather, the lack of it.
 
The small, unassuming spot where the burner phone usually resides is empty, a void that seems to be mocking me in its emptiness. The sickening drop in my stomach is immediate, a harsh realization washing over me like an ice-cold wave - the burner phone, my lifeline, my secret link to the world beyond these opulent walls, is gone.
 
The gravity of what it means hits me, knocking the breath out of my lungs.

## Bella
 
The warehouse swallows us in its belly, a vast cavern choked with towering shelves and forgotten crates. Moonlight seeps in through the grimy windows above, casting an ethereal, dim light that flickers and dances over the huge space. It's quiet. Dead quiet. A shroud of silence blankets the place, pressing down on my chest as we tread deeper into its depths. Ever confident Luca guides us through the labyrinth of crates and heavy machinery. Despite the gravity of our situation, I can't help but admire how he handles it all. I trail behind him, my heart pulsing with an uncomfortable blend of anxiety and thrill. Yes, the risk is real and looming, but we're not walking into it unprepared.
 
Finally, we make it to a corner that's been turned into a makeshift office. A dim desk lamp throws a patch of light over a table littered with scattered papers and maps. A few chairs are haphazardly spread out. This is our war room, the planning hub for the heist.
 
As I drop into a cold metal chair, it sends a shiver through my body. The room is dim, casting odd shadows on the walls. "Where is everyone?" My voice wavers, an edge of anxiety bleeding into it.
 
Checking his wristwatch, Luca's face is as calm as a still pond. "They'll be here soon," he says, his voice a steady anchor in the ominous silence.
 
A car purrs somewhere outside, the crunching gravel under its tires growing louder as it gets closer. My pulse races, anticipation tangling with anxiety in my veins.
 
Luca gives my hand a reassuring squeeze. "We've got this," he murmurs, his eyes locking onto mine with determination. The sound of approaching footsteps prickles my skin, and I take a deep, steadying breath.
 
Rico is the first to breach the warehouse's silence, his confident swagger commanding attention. He's decked out for the heist, black attire hugging his muscular build, designed to meld into the shadows. His dark eyes take in the surroundings as he hauls a large, ominous black bag. His approach sends a ripple through me, a nudge of unease.
 
Luca acknowledges him with a curt nod; Rico reciprocates and unceremoniously dumps his bag on the floor with a hollow thud. He looks at me, and our eyes meet. For a moment, I see an emotion flash across his face. What’s that? Hatred? Then its gone.
 
"Where's my father?" Luca's question breaks the silence, eyes fixed on Rico.
 
"He's still in the car. Should be in any second now," Rico says, glancing towards the entrance.
 
As we wait, anticipation charged like a live wire, a tense hush descends upon the room. I steal a glance at Luca, seemingly calm and composed, but I know the pressure is gnawing at him beneath that veneer, as it is at me.
 
The warehouse's rusty doors creak again, again to admit Vittorio Vella. Clad in a perfectly tailored charcoal suit, his salt-and-pepper hair combed to sleek perfection, he exudes an air of refined authority. His piercing blue eyes sweep the room as he steps in. Tailgating him is Bianca, her slender figure accentuated by a sharp black pantsuit and pristine white blouse. They march towards the central table, Vittorio's steps exuding confidence, Bianca's poised and elegant. They occupy their seats, Vittorio commanding the head, Bianca stationed beside him.
 
"Why is Bianca here?" The surprise in Luca's voice is laced with irritation.
 
Vittorio's gaze on Luca is as steady as a rock. "I believe she brings something valuable to the table," he responds, his tone unwavering and decisive, a clear final word on the matter.
 
Luca's jaw tenses, clearly displeased, but he swallows his protest. The tension in the room thickens.
 
Vittorio addresses Luca, "Ready, son?"
 
Luca's response is immediate. "Yes, I've rehearsed the plan ad infinitum and am confident in its execution. Every detail has been accounted for."
 
Vittorio's approval is evident in his nod, turning to Rico, "And you, Rico? Are all ends tied up?"
 
"Without a doubt. I've inspected the house again, confirmed the cars, and ensured the escape route is clear. All systems go."
 
"Excellent," Vittorio voices his approval, a decisive edge to his tone. "As for the rest of us," he glances at Bianca and me, "we each have a part to play. Unity, trust, and impeccable execution are key."
 
Rico squirms in his seat. Vittorio picks up on it. "What's the matter, Rico?"
 
There's a brief hesitation before Rico voices his concern. "Just... I can’t shake the risk we are taking with her." He nods in my direction. His words hang heavily in the tense silence.
 
"We have discussed this, Rico," Vittorio says.
 
"I get that," Rico concedes, "but there's a lot at stake."
 
An uneasy silence follows, everyone on edge. Rico's gaze flits between Luca and Vittorio, finally emitting a resigned sigh. "Fine," he grumbles, "I just wanted to confirm we're all in alignment."
 
Luca holds his glare for a heartbeat longer before retreating to his seat, his fiery expression cooling. The tension persists, but Vittorio nods in approval, signaling the resolution of the issue.
 
Vittorio surveys the room, his gaze locking with each of ours. "If no one has further concerns, are there any final queries before we proceed?" His question hangs in the air, echoed by the silence that fills the warehouse. Seeing that no one has anything else to contribute, Vittorio nods. "Very well," his strong, commanding baritone voice asserts, "I wish you all the best tonight. Let's ensure a smooth and triumphant execution."
 
The group is engulfed in resolve as we brace ourselves for the forthcoming task. Despite looming threats and uncertainties, we are unwavering in our commitment to see the heist through.
 
Vittorio rises from his seat, smoothing out his suit. "I need to depart now. I have faith in you to execute the plan we've outlined. Good fortune be with you."
 
Bianca mirrors his action, standing up from her chair. She scans the group, her gaze lingering briefly on each individual. "Good luck, everyone," she bids with a small yet confident smile.
 
Vittorio and Bianca leave the warehouse, the echo of their footsteps trailing behind them.
 
Rico swivels to face Luca; his face etched with seriousness. "Luca, we need to talk in private," he states.
 
"Alright, I'll wait in the car," I respond, ignoring my annoyance.
 
The cool night air greets me as I step outside, and the dim lighting of the warehouse district casts ominous shadows on the ground. I make my way to our vehicle, its sleek black silhouette gleaming under the sparse illumination of the street lamps. I sink into the passenger seat, the plush leather cradling me. Muffled voices seep from the warehouse, their intensity making me strain to catch their words, but to no avail. A surge of unease bubbles up inside me, and I can't help but ponder what the argument could be about.
 
Rico bursts out of the warehouse, his face a livid red and his movements rigid with fury. Without hesitation, he yanks open his car door, slams himself in, and revs the engine to life. His tires screech in protest as he races away, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust. A few moments later, Luca steps out of the warehouse, a furrowed brow and a troubled look in his eyes. He glances in my direction, his gaze fleeting but intense.
 
"I have to make a call. Just hold on for a moment, Bella."
 
He retreats into the warehouse, leaving me alone with my swirling thoughts. What could have transpired between Rico and Luca and how it might impact our heist gnaws at my peace of mind. The dread, like a chilling knot in my stomach, amplifies as I wait for Luca, and the ominous shadows cast by the scant street light seem to morph into threatening figures, heightening my discomfort.
 
My phone's sudden vibration startles me. I snatch it from the seat beside me, my heart pounding against my ribs as I read the message displayed:
 
'Bring the painting to me when you have it. Come alone. If you fail to show up or involve anyone else, Vittorio will learn your true identity. I'll send you the coordinates once the job is done.'
 
Trepidation clenches my heart as I read the words. My gaze flickers nervously around, trying to discern any indications of being watched. The once innocuous shadows now feel sinister, potentially concealing danger.
 
Shaking, I type a response.
 
'Who are you? What do you want with me?’
 
I hold my breath, anticipation coiling tight, but no response comes.
 
The seconds morph into eternity as I sit there, my mind a whirlwind of questions and fear. Who is behind this message? What do they know? What are their intentions?
 
I can now rule out Vittorio, but that’s little comfort.
 
Luca reemerges from the warehouse, determination etched on his face, breaking me out of my thoughts. I swiftly lock my phone and tuck it away in my pocket, attempting to mask my internal chaos. As he slips into the driver's seat and ignites the engine, I find myself questioning if there's anyone I can truly trust.

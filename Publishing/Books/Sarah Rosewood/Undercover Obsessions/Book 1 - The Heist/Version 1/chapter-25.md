## Bella
 
My skin prickles with the lingering sensations of Luca's touch; our morning tryst seared into my senses. His cologne, intoxicatingly masculine, clings to the sheets and me.
 
Luca had woken me early. His penis poking into me before I had even opened my eyes. It's like he can’t get enough of me. I feel that I am constantly filled with his seed. Honestly, I am a little sore, and my buttocks still hurt from his belt, and I am a little sore from where he penetrated me. I had never had sex like that before. I wanted to say no, to stop him, but I was powerless against his desire. And… well, I enjoyed it; I am embarrassed to admit it and it makes me feel like a slut but I like being used by him; I have never known a man with so much passion.
 
The steady drumming of the shower in the background is a reminder of his presence. I picture Luca under the spray - strong, toned, his body wrapped in tendrils of steam as he washes off traces of our passion. The potent and vivid image sends a flutter of want coursing down my spine.
 
Enveloped in plush sheets, a rare moment of tranquillity settles over me - until the reality of the text message slams back into focus; my pulse quickens, a wave of dread washing over me, causing my stomach. I force myself to breathe, to think rationally.
 
What's the reality? What do I know?
 
My burner phone is missing, but they'd have to call a Soho restaurant if they dialed the only stored number. So it's unlikely they've uncovered my real identity.
 
I slow my brain and force myself to think logically.
 
What do they know?
 
I am someone from the outside, and I have a secret phone.
 
I breathe deeply.
 
Yes, if I was an undercover police officer, then that’s the kind of thing I’d have. However, it's also true that if I was from a rival gang, risking my life to steal a painting, I might also have a backup phone.
 
Breathe Bella, think.
 
If whoever sent the message thought I was a police officer, they would have killed or snitched on me.
 
Or… they are waiting to use the information for their gain. 
 
The possession of the burner phone might raise questions, but it doesn't necessarily point to my undercover status. They're probably playing a game, attempting to flush me out.
 
But who's behind this? It could be anyone - they all had access to my room that fateful night. A horrifying thought flashes across my mind - could it even be Luca? It feels unlikely... unimaginable.
 
Can I trust him? Is Luca truly on my side?
 
I close my eyes and think.
 
Vittorio would have killed me on the spot. He’d have bundled me in a car and buried me in the woods. He’s impulsive. So it's unlikely to be him.
 
Bianca is selfish and manipulating, but all she cares about is power. If she knew, she’d be unable to resist tell Vittorio and use me as a pawn for some bigger game.
 
Luca… I shake my head. Luca? No. Could he do that to me? I shake my head again. If I have to trust one person, it would be Luca.
 
Which leaves Rico.
 
The muted rhythm of the shower cuts off, the abrupt silence replaced by the soft rustling of a towel. Luca reappears, his only garment a towel slung low on his chiseled hips. His skin glistens with the remnants of the shower, droplets clinging to his muscular form, twinkling in the morning light. His hair, tousled and damp, adds an irresistible allure to his handsome features. However, worry tinges his striking emerald eyes as they find mine.
 
"You alright?" he questions, the depth of his concern echoed in his tone. He traverses the room swiftly, every line of his tall, athletic build radiating an inherent masculine confidence.
 
I nod. "Yeah, I'm okay," my voice betraying a hint of my underlying anxiety.
 
He scrutinizes my face for a few more moments, his gaze seemingly piercing through me. A gentle smile graces his lips as he tucks a stray lock of my hair behind my ear, a simple act that sends a jolt of warmth cascading down my spine, emphasizing our potent connection.
 
The chirp of his phone breaks the intimate moment. He scoops it off the nightstand, scanning the incoming message. The easy warmth that permeated the room moments ago dissipates, replaced by palpable tension. His gaze flickers towards me, filled with a flash of indecision before he exits the room, the door clicking shut behind him.
 
My heart hammers against my ribcage as I strain to catch fragments of his muffled conversation. I can't decipher the words, but the urgent tone is unmistakable. My mind whirls, speculating about the sudden shift in Luca's demeanor. Time stretches, seeming like an eternity, until the door swings open again, revealing Luca with a clouded, serious expression. Deep in thought, he stands motionless before his voice slices through the silence.
 
"We need to chat, Bella," he intones, his voice firm yet filled with a gentle undercurrent.
 
"Luca, what's happening?" I manage to squeak out, my tone barely a whisper.
 
Drawing a deep breath, his gaze holds mine. "We're moving out tonight, Bella. The operation is a go. We're meeting at the warehouse in an hour."
 
The sudden urgency throws me off balance, my pulse quickening. Our plans, meticulous preparations, and everything we've been striving for are about to come to fruition. A whirlpool of exhilaration and trepidation churns within me, grappling with the weight of Luca's words.
 
"An hour?" I say, my voice trembling. "Are we ready?"
 
Luca's response is a firm nod, his face etched with resolution. "We have no choice. We've done our best to prepare. Now it's time to act."

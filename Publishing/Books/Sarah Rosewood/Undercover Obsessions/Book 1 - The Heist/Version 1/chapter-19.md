## Bella
 
My eyes flutter open, and the world becomes focused as my mind stirs from the drowsy state. The rays of morning sunlight stream through the partially drawn curtains, painting the room in a vibrant shade of gold. The warmth of the light caresses my skin, nudging me from the peaceful abyss of sleep. The sheets beneath me are luxuriously soft, a comforting contrast to the cool air of the bedroom. A soft sigh escapes my lips as I stretch languidly, basking in the rare sensation of peace and tranquillity.
 
Memories of the previous night come rushing back, the scent of Luca’s cologne still lingering on the pillow beside mine. My heart skips a beat at the remembrance of his strong arms around me, the feel of his body against mine, the intoxicating blend of tenderness and passion that was Luca. My hand moves to my throat. I turn to his side of the bed, I find it empty, the sheets cool to the touch.
 
“Luca?” I call out, my voice echoing in the vast emptiness of the room. The sound hangs in the air, unanswered, and a knot forms in my stomach.
 
There's no response, the silence amplifying my sudden anxiety. I sit up and gaze around the room but find no sign of him. A flutter of worry takes root in my chest. Casting the sheets aside, I swing my legs over the edge of the bed, my bare feet making contact with the plush carpet. The house is eerily quiet, and an unsettling feeling sweeps over me. As I stand and begin to search for Luca, I can’t help but wonder why he's left so abruptly and where he could be.
 
I open the door to my bedroom. “Luca.” My voice echoes through the house. I am alone.
 
I go back to bed. An involuntary smile plays on my lips as I recall the events of the party. When I had asked Luca to dance, I hadn't expected him to say yes. It was merely a playful jab, an attempt to see if I could push his boundaries. But without hesitation, he had taken my hand and led me onto the dance floor. His strong hand in mine, his confident steps guiding us through the rhythm of the music, his intense gaze locked onto mine—it was a dance that had felt like much more than a simple sway to the music.
 
It had been intoxicating, like a spell that I had no desire to break. I had always prided myself on my independence and ability to stay in control, but Luca’s assertive presence had elicited an entirely new feeling. The way he had taken command on the dance floor and led our dance with such assertive masculinity was an allure I had never experienced before.
 
I remember the heat between us, a magnetic pull that grew with each passing second, with each shared glance, each brush of his fingers against my skin. I had been determined to keep things professional between us, to maintain the boundaries of our partnership. But Luca had managed to blur those lines in his own unique, commanding way. His dominance had been intoxicating, the strength of his character making me yearn to submit to his will. It was an unfamiliar sensation, a yearning I had never known. Never before had I felt such a strong desire to please someone, to meet their gaze and see the approval in their eyes.
 
But with Luca, it felt natural, almost necessary. His aura was different, commanded respect, and made me want to give him more. I wanted to please him, meet his expectations, and be the one he saw when he closed his eyes.
 
I had gotten in the car with a resolve of steel, determined to keep my boundaries intact. But everything had crumbled the moment his hand touched me. It was as if a switch had been flicked, and suddenly, my only desire was to please him, to submit to him, to let him take me on a ride of exquisite pleasure.
 
I remember how his fingers moved, the deliberate slow strokes that radiated waves of pleasure from my core. I remember the feel of his rough fingers against the delicate lace of my knickers, the way he had pushed aside the thin barrier to touch my bare skin, the way he had taken control.
 
And the climax.
 
The explosive wave of pleasure that had washed over me was unlike anything I had ever experienced. It was all-consuming, a heady rush that took my breath away. It wasn't just an orgasm but a declaration, a revelation of the uncharted depths of my desire for him, the undeniable connection that had sparked between us. I was in his control, lost in the tidal wave of pleasure he was dictating, and it was the most liberating experience I had ever known.
 
Luca's dominance, his all-consuming presence, the way he took control of my body and my pleasure... it was entirely new, entirely thrilling. I'd been with men before, but none had ever claimed me as Luca did. None of them had ever made me feel so wanted, so owned.
 
The feel of him deep inside me was like being swept up in a storm of raw, primal desire. He was like a god, commanding, powerful, using me to sate his lust, his pleasure intertwined with mine. I know there is a part of me that should be rebelling against this, a part of me that should be clinging to my independence, my autonomy. But instead, I found myself surrendering to him completely, letting him guide me through a maze of pleasure and intensity that left me breathless. I have spent so much of my life trying to control the world around me, and stave off negative emotions and potential hurt by trying to dictate every aspect of my life. But at times, it is exhausting. To be able to give up that control is liberating.
 
And then, those words...
 
"You belong to me."
 
They echo in my mind, stirring a whirlwind of emotions. What had he meant? Was it just a heat-of-the-moment declaration spurred by the intimate act we were engaged in? Or was it something more?
 
There's a part of me that shivers at the thought, a part of me that finds the idea strangely appealing. It's not about ownership, not really. It's about belonging. It's about connection. It's about being so intertwined with another person that the line between where he ends and I begin becomes blurred.
 
But it also scares me. I've never been one to rely on someone else, to let myself be vulnerable. But with Luca, it feels different. With him, I want to let go. I want to belong. But what does that mean for me, for us? What will I lose... and what could I potentially gain?
 
The sudden buzz of my phone on the bedside table jolts me from my thoughts. I glance at the screen, a text message from Luca lighting up the display.
 
'I'll be home in thirty minutes. Be ready.'
 
The message is short, straightforward, typical Luca. But I can't remember any plans we made for this morning. Did I forget something in the haze of last night's events? He must mean breakfast. That will be it; after all, the man has to eat, right? A smile tugs at my lips at the thought of preparing breakfast for him, of seeing his face light up when he walks into the kitchen to find coffee brewing and breakfast on the table.
 
I hop into the shower, washing away the remnants of sex. The hot water feels amazing against my skin, soothing the slight ache from our passionate lovemaking. My arms are a little stiff from them being held so tightly, the discomfort makes me smile. Wrapped in a towel, I step into the bedroom and choose a simple pair of lace underwear and a silk dressing gown.
 
I head into the kitchen, my bare feet cool against the smooth tiles. I set about making coffee, the rich aroma filling the air as the machine whirs to life. While the coffee brews, I contemplate what to make for breakfast. Luca strikes me as a man who appreciates a hearty meal. As I mull over my options, I can't help but feel a flutter of excitement in my belly. This is all so new, so unexpected. It's a side of life I've never experienced before but one I find myself eager to explore.
 
I hear Luca's car pulling up, and I stand up, preparing to greet him. I can feel my heart racing with anticipation, unsure what to expect.
 
The moment Luca steps through the door, I'm struck by how commanding he looks. His suit fits him like a glove, emphasizing the breadth of his shoulders and the hard lines of his muscular frame. The slate grey of the fabric starkly contrasts his shirt's crisp white, the top button left undone in a casual manner. His usually immaculately styled dark hair is now slightly tousled as if he's been repeatedly running his fingers through it. But it's the anger in his eyes that truly catches my attention. They're ablaze, an intense fire burning within them that sends an involuntary shiver down my spine. It's a side of Luca I haven't witnessed before, his usual cool and controlled demeanor replaced by a raw, untamed fury. It's as terrifying as it is captivating.
 
"Why weren't you waiting for me?" he snaps. His voice is strained, frustration seeping through each syllable. The question hangs heavy in the air between us. His eyes, still flaming with that uncharacteristic rage, bore into mine.
 
A rush of guilt hits me square in the chest. Is that what his message meant? Was I supposed to be waiting for him? But waiting for what? His sudden anger and my confusion create a chaotic whirlpool of emotions in me.
 
"I...I thought you meant for breakfast..." I stutter out, gesturing helplessly towards the breakfast I had been preparing. "I didn't realize you… you wanted me to wait."
 
But my words seem to bounce off him, his intense gaze not faltering, his frustration not diminishing. I can't help but feel the immense weight of his disappointment. But why? I was just trying to do something nice for him. Isn't that what people who care for each other do? Or perhaps, in Luca's world, it isn't.
 
"I… I am waiting for you, Luca," I reply, my confusion evident in my voice. I gesture to the kitchen, the cup of coffee steaming on the counter. "I've been here, waiting. I am making you breakfast."
 
“Why the fuck are you making me breakfast?”
 
Confusion washes over me. “I… thought that was what you wanted.” I suddenly feel stupid, like a little girl that has done something wrong.
 
His eyes narrow as he studies me, and I can see the anger in his gaze. "So you love being in the kitchen?”
 
His question is weird, I am not sure how to answer it. “I…”
 
“So,” he says, anger still tinging his voice. “Do you want me to fuck you here?" he says, pointing at the table. "Or there." He points to the cold floor. “Or maybe there.” He points to the counter top.
 
Understanding washes over me, a cold tide of realization that sends a shudder down my spine. Fear gnaws at the pit of my stomach, knotting my insides as the gravity of the situation hits me.
 
Fuck. No wonder he is angry.
 
Luca moves towards me, his long strides closing the distance between us with predatory grace. His hand wraps around my arm, his grip firm and unyielding, and a startled gasp escapes my lips. There's a forcefulness to his touch, a strength that leaves no room for resistance.
 
In a seemingly fluid motion, he guides me towards the stairs. His hold on my arm is constant, a physical reminder of his control. For a moment, I think about resisting, about pulling back. But… he’s right. He knows best. His message was clear. Each step echoes in the silence that envelops us, a soundtrack to the anxiety drumming a fast rhythm in my chest. I can only follow, carried along by his will, my heart pounding with a mixture of apprehension and strange, forbidden excitement.
 
As we enter my bedroom, I brace myself for whatever is about to happen.
 
“Remove your gown,” Luca says.
 
With a deep breath, I coax my trembling arms out of the silken sleeves, allowing the lightweight material to cascade down my body and pool around my feet. The air in the room cools my skin, a sharp contrast to the warmth of the robe, making me all too aware of my semi-nudity. A sense of vulnerability sweeps over me, leaving me feeling exposed and somewhat apprehensive under his intense gaze. My heart beats a rapid tattoo against my ribs, an audible reminder of my mounting nervousness.
 
I search his face, seeking any hint of his thoughts, his feelings. Yet, his expression remains as impenetrable as a fortress, giving away nothing. In the silence that follows, the sound of my racing heart is deafening, and I find myself anxiously waiting for him to break the silence. The room feels thick with anticipation, his unreadable expression only adding to the mounting tension.
 
"Put your hands on the bed and bend over," he orders.
 
My breath catches in my throat as I inhale, gathering the courage to follow his command. Trembling, my hands find their place on the plush mattress, the cool fabric beneath my fingertips a stark contrast to the heated rush coursing through my veins. My back arches naturally, my body exposed and awaiting his next move. A thought of resistance flashes across my mind but when I turn my head and meet Luca’s it quickly dissolves. The deep intensity in his gaze penetrates my wavering resolve and a new understanding settles within me. I am willingly surrendering myself to his control. This submission has an odd tranquility, a sense of belonging that I've never experienced before.
 
A blend of fear and anticipation weaves through my body, setting my nerves on fire. My gaze flicks over my shoulder, my eyes searching his, attempting to unravel the mystery that is Luca. But, he remains a fortress, his thoughts hidden behind those dark, unreadable eyes. Vulnerable, exposed, and somewhat exhilarated, I await his next move, my heart pounding in my chest, mirroring the rhythm of my anticipation.
 
I can't tear my eyes away from my compromised stance as Luca starts to unbuckle his belt. Its slick, opulent leather captures the subdued glow of the room, glinting with a hint of menace. His every move is deliberate and meticulous, each action seeping with a degree of control that only amplifies the tension in the room.
 
Luca's digits curl around the shiny buckle, unhinging it with a muffled click that reverberates in the room's hush. As the belt slithers free from the confines of his trouser loops, the gentle rasp of leather against fabric prickles at my senses, sending a frisson of trepidation down my spine. He dangles the belt from his firm grasp, its weight asserting a presence in the room. His other hand clutches the buckle firmly, exuding an aura of unspoken dominance. The fervor in his gaze is magnified, striking me with an intensity that leaves me on edge.
 
A tumultuous cocktail of fear and expectancy swirls within me, my mind teetering on the brink of uncertainty, not knowing what the ensuing moments will unfurl.
 
"When I said you belonged to me, I wasn't joking," he declares.
 
“I know,” I say.
 
“You do what I tell you to do when I tell you to do it.”
 
"Y… yes," I manage to stutter. My instincts scream at me to fight, to assert that no man can dictate my actions. Yet, this contradicting desire to appease him, to surrender my control, bubbles within me.
 
"You were to be ready, but you weren't," he states.
 
"I...I was confused," I mutter, my voice barely more than a whisper. I can feel the prickling sting of tears threatening to spill from my eyes. The distress of having disappointed him gnaws at me. All I want is to bring him satisfaction, for him to beam with pride for me.
 
He steps forward and smacks my buttock with the flat of his hand. The noise echoes through the room, and a sting of pain spikes through my body. I let out a whimper and turn to look at him.
 
“Don’t fucking look at me,” he snarls and grabs a handful of the hair on my head. He yanks my face away from him. The pain spikes through my body, but then it's gone. I know its wrong but the sensation is thrilling. I feel alive. I suddenly want to submit, to allow this man to take control. I want to forget about being undercover, slipping up and getting caught, collecting evidence, being Russian, and everything. I just want to let my mind go blank.
 
“Sorry,” I said.
 
“You will be.”
 
He smacks me again, this time harder. I wince at the pain. I close my eyes. I want to scream, but something stops me; I don’t want him to think I am weak. I don’t want him to think I can’t take this. I pull in a deep breath as I wait… wait for another smack.
 
I realize I am wet. Sexual pleasure throbs through my body. I ache in a way I have never felt before. This man, forcing his will on me, spanking my backside like a little naughty school girl, is turning me on like no other man has ever done.
 
“Are you sorry?”
 
“Yes,” I said.
 
“Yes, what?”
 
I hesitate. Panic flashes through my body. What does he want?
 
Fuck, quick.
 
“Sir,” he barks. I feel him move his face next to my ear. “You call me sir.”
 
“Y… es, yes,” I whimper. “Yes, sir.”
 
I want to fight back, but I hate that I have upset him. I should have known, it's my fault. He’s only trying to help me. I want to please him and for him to be happy with me.
 
I feel his fingers on the elastic of my knickers. He pulls at them. I feel the material rip as he yanks them off my body and down my legs. They hang loose about my ankles. I know he will look at my bare red buttocks. It excites me. I imagine his hard penis pushing against his boxes. Suddenly, I want him inside me. I want to feel his sperm filling me like it did last night.
 
“I will show you who is in charge.”
 
I feel his hand on my buttock; for a moment, I tense, waiting for the spank, but it doesn’t come. He moves his hand between my legs, pushing two fingers inside me. They slip in.
 
“Shit,” he says. “You are dripping like a little slut. You fucking love this. You love having a real man. Better than those Russian potato farmers that you let fuck you as you grew up.”
 
I want to reply and explain the mixed emotions. I want to tell him how excited he makes me, but that I am also embarrassed that I am so excited, that I feel shame that being treated this way is making me wet. I want to say all these things but I don’t. I can’t. All I can do is close my eyes and moan in pleasure.
 
His fingers push deeper inside me. I gasp. He removes his fingers, and I am left, legs open, buttocks exposed, pussy dripping.
 
He’s right; I am a slut.
 
A hot white flash of pain shoots through my body while simultaneously hearing the crack of leather on my skin. My buttocks feel like they are on fire. I let out a yelp of pain. I look over my shoulder to see him holding his belt, ready to hit me again.
 
“I said don’t look.”
 
Fuck. He did. He was clear about that. I am so stupid. I turn my head back, and the belt bites into me again, the sounds of the leather on my skin followed by the pain. As the pain subsides, I realize I am tingling between my legs.
 
“Sorry,” I said.
 
“Sorry, sir,” he says, the words a snarl. The belt strikes again, and I let out a scream of pain this time. “Call me sir.” He is shouting the words.
 
“Sorry, sir,” I said. “Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir.”
 
I want him to stop, but I want to please him.
 
I feel him move behind me. I can see his legs as he steps closer. I want to turn, look at him, and see his face, but I can’t. He told me not to. He leans in, his lips next to my ear. “Good girl,” he says, his voice almost a whisper. A flood of emotion pulses through me. I have never felt anything like it before. Those two words melt me.
 
At this moment, all I want in the work is to be his good girl.
 
His legs are gone.
 
I hear the zip of his trousers. He places his hand on my buttocks, pushing them down a little. Fear flashes through my head. What is he doing? A moment later, his cock is inside. I feel it part my lips and push deep into me. It is hard. Harder than I have felt before. It is filling me up. I want him. I want him more that anything I have ever wanted. All I can think about is staying still and allowing him to thrust into me.
 
He is slow at first, controlled and gentle. Pleasure washes through me with each thrust. Then harder, deeper. I can hear his gasps of pleasure.
 
I know I am going to cum. Like the little slut he has made me, pleasure washes over me. My orgasm is sudden and unexpected. I try not to scream with pleasure but noise escapes my mouth. As my orgasm peaks he explodes inside me. I can feel him squirting into me, filling me up with his sperm. Each time he moves into me, a new wave of pleasure floods over me. He thrusts a few more times and pulls out.
 
“Stay there,” he says. I want to move. I feel exposed but he has been clear.
 
I wait, hands on the bed, buttocks in the air, legs apart, feeling his thick cum dripping down the inside of my legs.
 
“Look at me,” he says. I turned, looking over my shoulder to see him standing behind me, phone in hand. “Smile,” he says with a giggle as the phone flashes.

## Luca
 
The golden liquid in the crystal tumbler catches the glow of my desk lamp, scattering rays of warm light onto the polished mahogany surface of my desk. The smooth, peaty aroma of the eighteen-year-old Scotch fills the room, a comforting presence amid the silence of my study. I take a sip, savoring the delicate dance of flavors across my tongue. There's comfort in this ritual, the simple act of pouring, holding, and tasting.
 
The high-backed leather chair creaks as I settle deeper into it, my mind not quite ready to let go of the scene at the diner. There’s an unaccustomed twist of concern in my gut that has nothing to do with Rico’s outburst. I'm not surprised that he doesn't trust Bella. The real surprise is that I do... and I'm unsure why.
 
The reality is that no one knows; Bella could be a cop. Rico might be correct. He’s also right to voice his concerns. That’s his job to keep us safe. But he crossed a line. I can’t have him challenge me directly, not in front of Bella or ever.
 
I let the whiskey burn distract me, my eyes scanning the room, tracing over the book-lined shelves, the paintings adorning the walls. It's a room that tells a story of my life, of passions and pursuits, hidden beneath a veneer of criminal activities.
 
My eyes fall on the closed door of my study. Just beyond it, Bella is somewhere in my house, her presence a silent reminder of the responsibility I have agreed to. She's a mystery, an enigma that I'm now committed to solving.
 
An unease settles over me as I contemplate the complexity she adds to the equation. I can't deny that I’m attracted to her. Her beauty is undeniable, but there’s something more in how she challenges me and looks at me. It’s... compelling.
 
Taking another sip, I let the smoky and rich whiskey taste wash over me. I know this isn't just a job anymore, that she's no mere assignment. Bella, with her intelligence and her fire, has become a distraction. And right now, I'm unsure whether that's a danger or a temptation.
 
The subtle vibration of my phone against the dark wood of my desk breaks me out of my contemplation. Rico's name flashing on the screen brings a sigh from me. Hesitant, I pick it up, swiping to answer.
 
"Rico," I say, my voice steady.
 
"Luca...We need to chat," Rico replies. His voice is steady too, but there's an edge of tension I'm not used to hearing.
 
"I agree." I respond, reclining back in my chair, the tumbler of whiskey heavy in my hand.
 
“I’m scared, Luca. We’ve never let anyone like Bella in before.” It's rare for Rico to voice his concerns so plainly. He’s always been more about action than words. Knowing Rico, he’s been planning this in his head, word for word.
 
"I understand your worry, Rico," I reply.
 
His fears are not unfounded, Bella is an unknown, a wild card. But then again, so was I when my father introduced me to this world. And if she's as intelligent and resourceful as I believe she is, she might just be the piece we've been missing.
 
‘Look Luca, if you say she’s cool, then I am happy with that, I’ll not let my feelings interfere again.’
 
‘Thanks Rico.’
 
‘We good?’
 
‘Hey brother, we are always good.’ I smile.
 
‘Great,’ he says and ends the call.
 
I put the phone back on the desk, my gaze returning to the golden liquid in my hand. All of it is swirling around in my head: Bella, Rico, the job. A distraction I don't need right now.
 
A memory of the scene at the diner floods back into my mind. Bella's wide-eyed look of surprise as I defended her against Rico's outburst. The force of my reaction surprises me, and I find my fingers unconsciously tracing the edge of my tumbler. I have never felt this level of protectiveness for anyone. Not since my mother passed. And certainly not for a woman who was a complete stranger until a few days ago. Yet, there it was - an urge, almost primal in its intensity, to keep her safe.
 
I stare into the amber depths of my whiskey, the ice cubes clicking together in a slow rhythm. I've always been good at compartmentalizing my emotions, keeping personal feelings separate from business. But Bella... she's different. From the moment she stepped into my house, I felt this... connection.
 
Part of me wants to believe that I am putting Rico in his place and that this is all part of the ‘managing the team’, but…
 
I let out a low chuckle. If anyone had told me a week ago that I'd be sitting here, contemplating my feelings for a woman I've barely gotten to know, I would have laughed in their face. But life, it seems, has a way of throwing curveballs.
 
Leaning back in my chair, I run a hand through my hair, the other still holding onto the tumbler. I could drown in my thoughts and the endless 'what-ifs' and 'maybes'. Emptying the remaining whiskey in one swift gulp, I place the tumbler back on the table with a solid thud.
 
I refill my tumbler and rise from the chair behind my desk in the study. As I leave the room, I examine the scattered maps and blueprints across the mahogany surface. I flick off the light and step out into the hallway. The stairway is dimly lit by the ambient light spilling in from the windows, and I navigate the steps carefully, whiskey causing my usually confident stride to falter slightly.
 
At the top of the stairs, I turn right down the hallway; my footsteps muffled by the thick Persian rugs lining the floor. To my left, a closed door leads to the master bedroom. To my right Bella's room. The door is slightly ajar. I pause for a moment, standing in the threshold, peering in. The room is dimly lit by a shaft of light from the open door, revealing Bella's sleeping form on the bed. Bella lies on her side, curled slightly into herself, her chest rising and falling with each deep, steady breath. A few strands of her dark hair have escaped from her messy bun, falling across her peaceful face, and the soft light makes her skin glow a warm, golden hue. She's tucked under the white duvet, with one arm stretching out above her head and the other tucked under her pillow. She looks so serene and at ease that I forget the dangerous world we live in for a moment. There's an innate vulnerability about her that tugs at something deep within me, a protective instinct that surprises me.
 
I watch her for a moment, captivated. Seeing her like this, so unguarded, stirs an unfamiliar feeling within me. There's a sense of longing, a desire to keep her safe from the world we've chosen to inhabit. I find myself silently promising to do everything in my power to ensure she remains as peaceful and undisturbed as she is in this moment.
 
I realize my cock is hard.
 
I could just take her, make her mine…
 
I push the door open and step into the room; I'm struck by how different it feels from the rest of the house, more personal, more intimate. My foot catches on the corner of a floor rug, sending me stumbling forward. My hand flails out for something, anything to catch myself on. It lands on the back of a chair, causing it to screech against the floor. The sound echoes throughout the quiet room, shattering the peaceful silence.
 
In a flash, Bella is awake, her initial confusion replaced by sudden fear. With a sharp gasp, she yanks the sheets up, pulling her knees to her chest. I halt in my tracks, hands shooting up in surrender.
 
"Bella," I breathe out, trying to sound as soothing as possible despite the situation. "It's me, Luca." My words hang in the air, a plea for understanding in her room's dark, disturbed tranquility.
 
‘What the fuck Luca,’ she says, anger flashing in her eyes. ‘Why are you in my room?’
 
"I... I'm sorry," I stutter, trying to regain my composure. The scent of whiskey wafts in the air between us. "I just... I wanted to show you something."
 
She blinks at me, bleary and disoriented. "Can't it wait till morning?" she mumbles, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.
 
"No, it... It can't," I say, feeling my face grow warm under her scrutiny. It's a testament to my inebriation that I can't keep the defensiveness out of my voice.
 
She squints at me, then at the glass in my hand. "Have you been drinking?" she asks, her voice clear now, concern lacing her words. I glance down at the half-empty tumbler, the amber liquid swirling inside, and give a sheepish grin.
 
"Yeah," I admit, "I guess I have." I chuckle.
 
"Fine," Bella grumbles, pulling her covers tighter around her. "But turn around. I need to get dressed."
 
I oblige, spinning around to face the door. The moonlight seeping in through the crack in the curtains illuminates the hallway in a ghostly glow, and I take a moment to steady myself, my hand resting on the doorframe.
 
From behind me, I hear the rustle of fabric, followed by the soft pad of her feet on the carpet. "Okay," she says, "I'm up. So, what's this thing that couldn't wait till morning?"
 
Her voice is laced with irritation, but there's an underlying note of curiosity that has me grinning in spite of myself.
 
She's standing there in a silk dressing gown, the pale fabric catching the moonlight and casting her in an ethereal glow. Her hair is messy from sleep, curling around her face in soft waves that frame her features. Her arms are crossed over her chest, the sleeves of the gown falling loosely around her wrists, revealing her delicate hands. Even in her irritation, there's a captivating beauty about her that I can't ignore.
 
"Follow me," I say, fighting to keep my voice steady. I'm aware of my disheveled appearance and the smell of whiskey that clings to me. I turn and stumble out of the room, trying to ignore the heady feeling that's making the world tilt around me.
 
With Bella close behind, we head down the stairs, my hand gripping the banister to steady myself. I'm careful not to rush, knowing that my intoxicated state isn't exactly conducive to sure-footedness. The kitchen is dark as we pass through. I lead her to a door at the back of the house and fumble in my pocket for the key. The lock is stubborn, resistant to my unsteady hands.
 
"Do you need help?" Bella's voice breaks through the darkness, her tone laced with worry and impatience.
 
"No," I grumble, coaxing the key into the lock. With a turn and a push, the door creaks open, revealing darkness beyond.
 
Bella hesitates at the threshold, her eyes wide. "Are you planning to rape and murder me?" she asks, her voice flat. I can't tell if she's joking or genuinely scared.
 
"No, Bella," I say, managing a small laugh that probably sounds more unsettling than comforting. "You're safe."
 
“That’s exactly what a serial killer would say.” Her voice is light but it is tinged with a note of worry.
 
I step into the darkness, trusting her to follow.
 
I reach for a light switch, flicking it on. The staircase beneath us is suddenly bathed in light, the bulbs overhead chasing away the darkness. Another door waits at the bottom, sturdier than the last. I shuffle my way down the steps, one hand on the railing for balance, the other clutching the key to the second door.
 
"I'm starting to get worried, Luca," Bella's voice floats down the stairs to me. It's a whisper, but I can hear the tension in it. I can almost picture her up there, hand clutching the railing, body tense with unease.
 
I look back up at her, my gaze steady despite the alcohol fogging my brain. "Do you trust me?" I ask. My voice's a quiet sincerity, a rare moment of vulnerability.
 
There's a pause as she seems to mull over her answer. She nods. "Yes," she says, her voice just above a whisper. "I do." Her voice has a certain warmth, a reassurance that seems to sober me up just a bit.
 
“Good, then follow me.”
 
The heavy door swings open with a soft creaking noise, revealing the space beyond. It's too dim to make out what's inside. Bella stands beside me, her shoulder brushing against mine in the confined space. She glances at me with curiosity evident in her eyes.
 
"What is this place?" she asks, her voice hushed as if afraid to disrupt the silence that clings to the room.
 
With a sly smile, I reach for another switch beside the door, the one that controls the main lights. With a flick of my wrist, the room is flooded with light, revealing the secret I've been eager to share with her. The soft light floods the expansive room as the switch flicks on, revealing a sight that never fails to captivate me. My hidden sanctuary, filled with tools of my secret passion, sprawls before me. An imposing easel occupies the heart of the room, splattered with remnants of countless painting sessions. On it, a half-finished abstract painting - a myriad of colors swirling into one another, a tempest contained within the confines of the canvas. I've been wrestling with it, attempting to encapsulate a feeling, a notion: the sensation of confinement, yet with the tantalizing promise of escape flickering at the periphery.
 
Beside the easel stands a rack, a riot of tubes of paint in every conceivable hue. Each tube, whether it contains a deep sea blue or an incendiary red, is a piece of frozen inspiration, a brushstroke frozen in time, ready to be unfurled onto the canvas. Like a silent army, brushes stand at the ready, bristles stained with past projects. Stacked along the walls, finished and incomplete canvases lean against each other. Their narratives are as diverse as their stages of completion, from vibrant, expressive pieces to nascent sketches whispering of future masterpieces. A sleek sink shines in a corner, spotlessly clean, the mark of an artist who takes pride in maintaining their creative space.
 
I watch as she enters the room, her eyes wide, her mouth slightly open, a picture of shock and awe. She turns, her gaze sweeping across the canvases stacked against the walls, over the shelves lined with paint tubes and brushes, and finally resting on the half-finished abstract painting on the easel.
 
She steps forward towards my current work in progress. She examines the brushwork, her eyes scanning each aspect of the painting. She steps back, admiring my work.
 
‘Did… did you do this?’ she asks a tone of surprise in her voice.
 
‘Yes,’ I say.
 
‘It's… good. Really good.’
 
‘Thank you.’
 
‘How long have you been painting?’ Bella asks. She is still wearing an expression of shock.
 
“I've been painting all my life," I confess, my voice barely above a whisper as the truth tumbles out. "I've taken a few private lessons here and there, but for the most part, I'm self-taught."
 
Bella steps closer to the easel, her hands held back, careful not to touch the half-finished painting. "Why's it all locked up down here?" she asks, her gaze questioning as she turns back to face me.
 
“My father…” I'm quiet for a moment, the vulnerability of the truth pricking at my composure. "He wouldn't approve," I admit.
 
"Why?" Bella prompts, her eyes never leaving mine.
 
I take a deep breath, the memory of a harsh past flickering behind my eyelids. "I painted a picture when I was a teenager," I said, the shadows of the past painting my words with bitterness. "Entered it into a competition. It won." My voice breaks a little, but I push on. "I told my father about it, expecting him to be proud... Instead, he called me a sissy, tore the painting into shreds, beat me so badly, and broke my nose. As I lay bleeding on the floor, he looked me in the eyes and said, ‘Only gay boys paint’." The last of my confession hangs heavy in the air, the silence deafening. "Since then, I've kept it a secret." The air seems to have thinned, my confession hanging heavy between us. The secret space, my sanctuary, feels all the more intimate with my truth laid bare.
 
"I'm sorry, Luca. Nobody should ever have to go through that." She steps a little closer to me, her eyes holding mine in an intense gaze that I find hard to break away from.
 
“I don’t blame him. He’s a man of his time. He is the way he is because that’s the only way he knows. He grew up having to fight for everything he owns. He has been fighting all his life. If he stops fighting, someone will come and take it all away, or that’s what he thinks. So, he teaches me to fight, he’s protecting me, as fucked up as it sounds.”
 
I look away. I had never thought about it like that before, but at that moment, I suddenly had an insight into my father that had escaped me for years.
 
“That doesn't mean its right.”
 
“No,” I say. “I didn’t say it was right, I said I understood. Anyway, I forgave him years ago.” I look at Bella. “You know what’s the worst thing though?” She shakes her head. “He’s right. This is a world where violence is a real currency, perhaps the only currency people understand. You saw it with Rico. I have to be tough.”
 
I see a look of concern flash across Bella's face. Her hand comes up as if she is going to touch my cheek, but it drops and she turns away. We stand in silence for a moment.
 
"Is the art around the house yours?" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper.
 
"Yes, it is," I say, a certain pride slipping into my voice despite the memories I've just shared. "My father doesn't know anything about art. He can't tell the difference between a Picasso and a Pollock. Hanging my paintings around the house right under his nose... it's my own small rebellion. My way of letting my work be seen without him ever knowing." I offer her a bitter smile, acknowledging the irony of it all. The desire to create and express is hidden away in the shadows of fear and disappointment.
 
In the stillness of the basement studio, Bella steps forward, closing the small distance between us. The next moment, I feel her arms wrap around me, pulling me into a warm, comforting embrace. Surprised by her gesture, I stiffened but let my arms encircle her in return. We hold each other, the scent of her, the warmth of her body against mine providing a balm to wounds long buried but never healed.
 
When we pull away, we remain close, our eyes locked on one another. Her eyes are sparkling with an intensity that I find both bewildering and enchanting, stirring emotions inside me that I've long kept in check. There's something transformative about this moment - a sense of vulnerability and intimacy shared in the solitude of this secret space. I find myself lost in her gaze, our shared silence becoming a profound conversation.

The anticipation of a kiss fills the air, an almost magnetic pull guiding me towards Bella. But as I lean in, she pulls back, breaking the tension that was building between us.
 
"Luca..." Her voice is soft, a soothing balm on the sting of rejection.
 
I instantly regret my impulsiveness and feel a rush of embarrassment color my face. Bella doesn't show any discomfort, making it even harder for me to digest the awkwardness of the situation.
 
"I...I think I should get some sleep," she says, her voice so low it's almost a whisper. "Thank you for showing me your studio. It means a lot."
 
I nod, unable to come up with any words in response.
 
The moment is over, leaving me with a strange mix of emotions and a taste of regret. She turns to leave, her silk dressing gown whispering against the concrete floor as she makes her way back to the staircase, leaving me alone in my studio.

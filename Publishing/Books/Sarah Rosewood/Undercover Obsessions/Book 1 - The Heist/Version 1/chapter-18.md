## Luca

My eyes are still closed as I draw my fingers along Bella’s back. She releases a soft sigh, the sound seeming loud in the stillness of the night. She is lying before me; her firm arse pushes against my rock-hard cock. I know she wants it, wants me. It's only been a few hours since she last came and she is ready to go again; she really is my little slut. I smile.
 
I open my eyes, allowing them to adjust to the dim light of the night. I can see her shape before me; her hair hangs down her back and the smooth outline of her hip and buttocks silhouettes against the darkness. She is naked, the little light that is present reflects off her white skin. My nose is inches from her neck. I breathe in deeply and catch the smell of her. It is an intoxicating mixture of perfume and the warmth of her recently sleeping body.
 
She woke me with her movement. I was asleep but she was restless. I am not used to someone next to me, so I woke up with a start. For a moment, I didn’t know where I was or who I was with but as the memories came folding back, I was filled with happiness. I could not resist touching her.
 
I now move my hips forward, pushing my hard cock against her soft arse cheeks. I feel her push back against me. At that moment, I want to fuck her. I picture my cock slipping between her legs and driving into her, cum spilling. I know she is thinking the same, thinking how it would feel to have my large prick deep inside her, stretching her pussy in a way she has never felt before. I know she has never had a man like me before, someone who will make her feel things she never knew were possible.
 
She pushes her arse against. She is eager, perhaps too eager.
 
I pull my hips back so my cock moves away from her back. I allow my fingers to drift down her back, tracing a line from her shoulders to her hips, her buttocks, and the small gap between her legs. I am about to tell her to open her legs for me, but she does so without me asking. She opens then just a bit, but enough to invite me in. I grasp her buttock and squeeze. She lets out a small sigh. I let my fingers find their way between her cheeks and towards her arsehole. I let them drift to the opening and the tip of my finger rests on the hole. I feel her pull away a little and then stop. I increase the pressure on her hole, allowing one finger to stretch her. She gasps and lets out a soft moan.
 
I pull my finger away and push my hand between her legs. I am fast and rough, my hand shooting to her pussy. I feel her legs open, accepting me. In the darkness, I feel the wetness on her flaps. She is soaking. My fingers glide with ease over her skin. She moans again and pushes against me, almost forcing my fingers inside her. She is eager. She has tasted what I can offer and now wants more. It's not the first time this has happened.
 
Ok, if she wants it, she will beg for it like the little slut she is becoming.
 
I push my fingers inside her. I trust them deep, pounding hard. I can hear the sound of her wetness as my fingers pound in and out of her. I feel her legs open more as I push my now soaking-wet hand into her from behind.
 
“Oh my God, Luca.” Her voice is tight and high-pitched.
 
She starts to say something else, but I pound in harder and faster, cutting the words off in her mouth. They are replaced by shallow gasps squeezing out with each thrust.
 
I stop. It is sudden.
 
I pull out my hand, leaving her legs slightly apart. I hear her let out a long breath. I move my wet hand and push a finger into my mouth. I can taste her sweetness on me. I suck the next finger and the next. My cock throbs with excitement as I let her juices coat my tongue.
 
“Luca,” she says, “I want you.”
 
I feel as she pushes her arse into my cock. The warmth of her skin sends a shiver of pleasure through my body.
 
I want her too, more than she knows. I want to grab her long hair as I pound her from behind. I want to bite her tits, leaving marks that will bruise and linger for days so she knows I am her property. I want to force her legs apart and fuck her while she begs for mercy.
 
“Luca, I need you.”
 
I move my body so my arm can reach around her body. She lets me to drap my arm over her, pushing herself against my body. I allow my still damp fingers to seach out her small tit in the darkness. I find the mound and squeeze. She lets out a small gasp. I move my fingers, searching out her nipple. I find it by touch and allow the tips to stroke the firm skin. She pushes against me with a soft moan. Using my thumb and finger, I grab her nipple and squeeze it hard. I know it will hurt. I want it to hurt. She lets out a small yelp. I imagine the thrill of the pain flooding through her body, followed by the sensation of relief as it subsides. I pinch again hard. The yelp is louder this time. I stop squeezing and caress the soft mound of her small tit.
 
I lay still, feeling her chest's soft fall and rise as she breathes. I move my hand from her tit and use my fingers to find the base of her throat. I follow the curve of her breastbone and let my fingers wrap around her neck. I am soft and don’t apply any pressure, just allowing my fingers to rest. I feel her move against me. I let my fingers tighten. At the same time, I push my cock against her. I feel her tense. I imagine the moment of fear flashing through her mind. I allow my fingers to press the blood vessels on the side of her neck, knowing it will cause her to be lightheaded. I wait a moment longer; by now, stars will be flashing across her vision. She will be starting to fight for breath. The panic rising. I stop, releasing my fingers. He takes in a big breath.
 
“Tell me what you want,” I say.
 
She starts to answer, but I squeeze, cutting off the words. I allow my fingers to pressure her neck for a few seconds and then release. She gasps for air.
 
“Do you want my cock?”
 
“Yes.”
 
I squeeze again. Harder this time. Longer. I can feel her try to gasp for air under my hand. Her hands start to come up and I release.
 
“Beg,” I say. “Beg for my cock like the slut you are.”
 
There is a moment of silence. “Please,” she says her voice little more than a whisper.
 
“Please what?”
 
“Please fuck me, please give me your cock.”
 
“Breathe in,” I say.
 
There’s a moment where she seems to register what I have asked. I feel her take a deep breath. At that moment, I let my cock slip into her wet pussy. I am not careful or caring. I fuck her. I am not making love; this is no romance novel this is pure, unbridled passion. I thrust my cock as deep as I can. She gasps. I squeeze her throat and, at the same time, drive my cock into her. I thrust three, four, five, six times, all the while I hold her neck.
 
I feel her body tense, and I release her throat. She lets out a huge gasp of air. I feel her body wracked with pleasure as she cums. I push into her again, as deep as I can. I pound into her. I start to lose track of my movement. I am lost in the moment and the pleasure. In the space of pure ecstasy, I cum inside her. My body spams with intense pleasure as I squirt into her pussy.
 
As my orgasm subsides, I relax. My fingers, which were moments before, were pounding her pussy, squeezing her nipples and grabbing at her neck, now drawing soft lines on her skin. I feel her relax into me. I keep touching her skin, stoking her softly, allowing my fingertips to draw invisible pictures on her skin. I lose track of time, but soon I feel her breath soften and deepen as she falls asleep.

I'm sitting at the kitchen counter when Bella enters the room. Her hair usually pulled back in a professional bun, now hangs loose around her shoulders, waves cascading down to her mid-back. Something is enchanting about the way it frames her face, highlighting her high cheekbones and those dark, almond-shaped eyes that always seem to be taking in everything around her. She's swapped her formal attire for a pair of faded jeans that fit her like a second skin and a loose, off-the-shoulder top that allows a glimpse of her collarbone. There's an air of vulnerability about her, a stark contrast to the guarded, professional woman I've been dealing with till now.
 
It's strange, I've known her for a short while, yet I find her oddly attractive. Almost fuckable. Not in the way one is drawn to Bianca with her lace lingerie and blatant sexuality, but in a subtler, more unsettling way. Bella possesses a quiet allure that draws you in without you even realizing it.
 
She glances my way as she enters, offering a small smile. "Is that coffee?" she asks, gesturing towards my mug.
 
I nod, pushing another cup towards her across the marble countertop. "Help yourself," I say, gesturing to the pot I'd brewed earlier. She pours herself a cup, her movements graceful and assured, and the scent of coffee fills the room, its warmth a reminder of the normalcy I crave and the complications that lie ahead.
 
"Any preferences for food?" I ask, leaning back in my chair and crossing my arms over my chest.
 
She shrugs, a small, shy smile playing at the corners of her mouth. "I'm not picky," she says. "What do you usually cook?"
 
I chuckle at that. "Cook? Me?" I shake my head, grinning at her. "I'm afraid I'm not the domestic type. My kitchen skills are pretty much limited to brewing coffee and making toast. I usually order in."
 
"Sounds like my kind of cooking," she replies, her eyes twinkling with amusement.
 
"So, do you like sushi?" I ask, already reaching for my phone.
 
Her face lights up, and she nods. "I love sushi."
 
"Great," I say, already typing a message to my favorite sushi restaurant. A few minutes later, the order is placed, and we fall into a comfortable silence, sipping our coffees and waiting for dinner to arrive.
 
"So, what do you like to do for fun?" I ask, attempting to break the uncomfortable silence between us.
 
She seems taken aback by the question, her brow furrowing slightly as she considers it. "Oh, you know, the usual," she says after a moment, her gaze dropping to the cup of coffee in her hands. "I like reading, going to the cinema, taking long walks..." She trails off, looking up at me with a hint of embarrassment. "You're probably not interested in any of that."
 
I shrug, leaning back in my chair. "You'd be surprised," I say with a smile.
 
I study Bella across the table, my gaze trailing over her face. There's an undeniable attraction, a kind of spark that flits across my mind, fleeting yet powerful. But I can't shake off a certain... guardedness about her. Her body language speaks volumes: the way she folds her arms, avoids my gaze, the slight frown that graces her lips every now and then. It all screams 'standoffish', a silent but firm wall between us.
 
I let my eyes drop to her chest, it's hard to see but she looks like she has nice tits, a bit small for my liking but worth the effort. I bet she has really pert nipples, one of these women with little breasts and bullets for nips. Perhaps she is worth a fuck, after all. Well, probably not. It would be so much effort. I bet she would want to chat for ages afterward.
 
She seems like a woman of contradictions: smart, yes, but also guarded. Attractive, no doubt about that, but also somewhat detached. And even though part of me is intrigued, the other half can't help but wonder if she might be too much work or too high maintenance.
 
Yet, there's something about her that tugs at my curiosity, makes me want to peel back those layers, and figure out what makes her tick. Maybe it's the challenge she presents, or maybe it's just the way she looks at me when she thinks I'm not watching, with a mix of curiosity and uncertainty. Whatever it is, I know one thing for sure: living under the same roof with Bella is going to be anything but dull.
 
The silence between us stretches on, hovering in the room like an unwelcome guest. Bella's gaze sweeps the room, taking in the intricate details. Her eyes land on a painting hanging on the wall behind me, her brow furrowing slightly as she inspects it. "I see you have a lot of original art," she muses, her gaze still fixed on the painting. "It's nice. Someone here must have an eye for it."
 
I can't help the smile that tugs at the corners of my mouth. I've always been proud of my art collection. "You're right," I reply, reclining in my chair, feeling strange satisfaction at her observation. "I have a soft spot for art. Actually, it was my idea that our...enterprise moved into art."
 
Bella's eyes snap to me. Her posture changes, her back straightening as she leans forward, her interest piqued. "Really?" she questions, her voice laced with curiosity. "That's interesting. I actually studied fine art at university."
 
Her admission surprises me, but it's a pleasant surprise.
 
“What is it you love about art?” I ask. If I am honest, this is a bit of a trap. I want to make sure she not bluffing.
 
"For me," Bella starts, folding her hands neatly on the table. "Art is a conversation between the artist and the viewer, a narrative that can cross centuries and cultures, yet remain fundamentally human." She pauses, collecting her thoughts.
 
“Go on,” I say.
 
"There is something so visceral about standing in front of a painting and feeling the weight of the artist’s emotion in each brush stroke, each color chosen, each texture created. Art has its own language, conveying a message that words sometimes can't encapsulate." Her eyes are alight with passion. "Every piece of art, no matter how small or grand, is a snapshot of the artist’s time, society, thoughts, and emotions. To see a work of art is to peer into the artist's soul and the era they lived in.
 
"Furthermore," she adds, leaning back in her chair, a soft smile playing on her lips. "Art is always evolving, always reflecting the times. It's a constant source of inspiration and a mirror of our society. There is nothing quite like the thrill of discovering a new artist or style that challenges the norms and pushes the boundaries of creativity."
 
I am impressed; this chick knows her stuff. To be honest, she sounds like she is reading from a wiki page, but some people are like that; her passion is there but there a distance from the work.
 
Sitting back in my chair, I take a moment to study Bella before responding. "To me," I start, a warmth in my voice reflecting her own passion, "art is a glimpse into a world that might not even exist. It's the creation of something out of nothing. It's more than just colors on a canvas or strokes on a paper. It's an emotion, a feeling, captured in a single moment and forever immortalized. It's an expression of the soul in its rawest form. The creation of beauty in an often bleak world."
 
As I speak, my fingers trace the rim of my coffee mug. "Art is an experience. A journey. It takes you places you've never been and shows you things you've never seen. It challenges you, pushes you to question and think, and at the same time, it comforts and soothes. It's... magic." I chuckle to myself, glancing down at my coffee. "And yet, it's such a personal thing, isn't it? No two people will experience a piece of art in the same way. It's like...each painting, each sculpture; it has a million stories to tell. And the story it tells you might be entirely different from the story it tells me." Looking up, I meet Bella's gaze again. "That's why I love art. For the mystery, the magic, and the million stories it hides within its strokes."
 
I watch Bella's reaction. Her eyes, previously shining with curiosity and intellectual vigor, soften. I notice a slight quirk of her lips, hinting at a smile that never quite reaches her mouth but is certainly there in her eyes. There's an unusual tenderness in her gaze as it meets mine. I can tell she wasn't expecting such an impassioned response.
 
She blinks, almost as if processing what I've just shared, before the silence between us is filled with her soft, slightly awed voice. "Luca, that was...beautifully put," she says, sincerity dripping from her words. "You've really given this a lot of thought, haven't you? Your understanding of art is... moving."
 
The surprise is clear in her tone, and it amuses me. Maybe she's beginning to realize that there's more to me than what meets the eye. As I watch Bella, lost in thought and clearly moved by my words, I can't help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction. My interest in art isn't something I usually share with others, but in this moment, I'm glad I did. We share a moment of mutual understanding, her blue eyes meeting mine in quiet comprehension. It's a moment I don't want to break, but the loud ring of the doorbell does it for us. Our gazes break, and I see a flicker of disappointment in her eyes that I quickly push away.
 
"Excuse me for a moment, Bella," I tell her as I push my chair back and rise, heading towards the door.
 
I pull it open to find a delivery guy standing there, clad in a black uniform with a cap pulled low over his eyes. He holds a large, white styrofoam container and a small paper bag, the unmistakable smell of sushi wafting from it. He passes over the container and bag. “It's on your tab,” he says. I smile. One of the advantages of being rich and a regular customer is getting a tab at your local sushi restaurant. Oh, and delivery, they don’t do that for just anyone. I close the door and turn back towards the kitchen, sushi in hand.
 
With a practiced hand, I begin to set out the meal on the sleek black granite countertop. I unwrap the white, rectangular box to reveal a stunning array of sushi, each piece looking like a small work of art. There's nigiri with glistening slabs of salmon and tuna atop perfectly shaped mounds of sushi rice and maki rolls filled with fresh avocado, cucumber, and glistening fish roe, each roll snugly encased in a wrap of nori seaweed. I also set out a tray of delicate sashimi, each slice of fish almost transparent in its thinness, resting atop a bed of shaved ice. The colors pop against the white porcelain dish: the deep pink of tuna, the vibrant orange of salmon, and the pale, almost iridescent white of octopus. Next to the sushi, I place a small dish of soy sauce and wasabi, the vibrant green contrasting beautifully with the inky darkness of the soy.
 
I reach into a cupboard, pulling out two ceramic cups, their deep, mottled blue glaze. I pour out the rice wine, the clear liquid sloshing slightly in the cups. The smell is sweet and tangy, promising a smooth, warming heat. Once everything is set out, I lead Bella over to the counter. We sit side by side, the sushi spread out before us, and begin to eat.
 
As I watch her, my eyes catch the graceful movements of her hands as she maneuvers her chopsticks. Each roll is picked up with a precision that speaks of practice and familiarity, the wooden sticks a natural extension of her fingers. There's a certain elegance to it that mesmerizes me, her slender fingers moving with a fluidity and finesse that seems almost out of place in the mundane act of eating.
 
I find myself drawn to her face, to the soft glow of the low-hanging lights on her skin. Her eyes are focused on her food, her long lashes casting a shadow over her high cheekbones. Her lips, full and colored a soft pink, open slightly as she takes a bite, her eyes closing for a brief moment as she savors the flavor. I find myself captivated, entranced by the simplicity of it. There's a beauty to it, a genuine warmth that stirs something in me, a feeling that's unfamiliar and yet welcome. I look away, trying to rein in my thoughts, to remember who she is and what she's here for.
 
Returning my attention to the task at hand, I clear my throat before speaking. "We're meeting Rico for breakfast in the morning," I tell her, trying to rein in the unexpected emotion swirling within me. "We'll go over the plan and try to get to know each other a little better."
 
Bella nods, her face serious as she chews. After a moment, she speaks up, her tone slightly hesitant. "I think Rico dislikes me."
 
I can't help but chuckle at that, sipping my rice wine to hide my amusement. "Rico dislikes everyone, especially pretty women," I say, setting my cup down with a small clink against the glass table. "It's his defense mechanism, how he's stayed alive all these years." I pause. “And single.” I smile.
 
Her eyebrows lift slightly, a soft 'huh' escaping her lips. I can see her mulling over my words, perhaps realizing that in our world, survival often means keeping your guard up, no matter who's in front of you. I watch her for a moment more before turning my attention back to my food, the taste somehow richer, the meal somehow more enjoyable.

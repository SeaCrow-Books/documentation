## Luca
 
My basement's a dingy, half-lit world, shadows sprawling across the concrete under a lone, tired bulb. Rusty pipes and raw wires cling to the walls, crisscrossing like veins in the cold underbelly of the house. Steel shelves claim the corners, cluttered with the tools of the trade and then some. And there, in the midst, a faithful workbench stands, weathered with memories of past exploits.
 
I'm locked in my zone now, gathering the gear for tonight's big show. A spark of anticipation lights up inside me, adrenaline ticking like a time bomb, but I keep my cool. I not gonna let slip-ups happen, not with Bella counting on me.
 
The gear's laid out on the bench, waiting for my final approval. I reach for the black ski masks, giving them a good stretch, making sure they'll shield our faces well enough. Gloves are a perfect fit to wipe out any chance of fingerprints. The rope's up next. I give it a firm tug, its resistance assuring me of its loyalty. I look over the grappling hooks, their steely resolve promising to help us climb and conquer. I check out the binoculars, tuning their eyes until they align with mine. The walkie-talkies get a sound check next, ensuring they'll sing loud and clear when it counts. I take the stun gun, giving it a once-over to confirm its readiness to pack a punch. The first aid kit's inventory gets a quick check. The flashlight's glow is strong enough to cut through the night. And lastly, I ensure the duffle bag's big enough to play its part in carrying our precious loot.
 
Every little piece gets my undivided attention, scrutinized over and over. I know that the smallest slip could knock down our whole house of cards, and that isn't happening on my watch.
 
I start packing, laying everything out in the bag, orderly, within easy reach. The ski masks and gloves go in first, ready to mask our identities and clean up after us. The rope gets coiled up nice and neat on one side, the collapsdable grappling hooks keeping it company, ready to take on walls and hurdles. The binoculars and walkie-talkies find their spot safely between the rope and hooks.
 
Next, the lock-picking tools, stun guns, and flashlights go in, nestled right in the bag's heart for easy access. I place the first aid kit on top, hoping it remains untouched but knowing it's gotta be there, just in case. The duffle bag for the painting, folded neat and crisp, tops off our haul. I zip up our main bag, each item snug and secure. Throwing the loaded bag over my shoulder, I test its weight. It's heavy with promise.
 
A moment's pause and my mind wanders off to Bella. Funny, how quickly we've gotten close. She's brought a splash of color into my life, a warmth I haven't felt. I think of her smile, her eyes spark when they meet mine, and her laughter ringing through the room. But just as fast, a worry creeps in, whispering that my feelings for her could blur my focus on tonight's job. I shake off that thought, knowing well how to box up emotions when the situation demands. I tell myself I've survived the heat before, and I can damn well do it again.
 
I steal a deep breath, getting my head back in the game.
 
As my eyes scan over the bag, I think of Rico. Can I genuinely bank on him for tonight? We've been thick as thieves for years, and he's always had my back. We've laughed, cried, and hustled together, each memory attesting to his loyalty. He's more than a partner in crime – he's a brother. He's a straight-up, cold-blooded man, ready to pull the trigger if need be, with a brutal efficiency that can be an asset as well as a worry. What if Rico's ice-cold instincts turn out to be a liability one day? But for now, I've got no option but to trust him.
 
I let out a sigh, shoving these worries aside. Now ain't the time for doubts. We've got a job to do, and I must ensure everything falls into place.
 
I suddenly remember my ‘escape kit’. I return to the desk. I reach underneath, my hands fumbling until I feel the edge of the tape. I pull the tape away from the underside of the desk, and a small plastic bag drops into my hand. It contains a small black burner phone and a little black book full of numbers. I press the power button for the phone and let it power up. The battery is at 100%. I turn off the phone and place it back in the plastic bag with the book. I seal the bag with the attached zip lock. I have spent hours deciding which number to write in the book. They are the only people I would trust with my life. I have tried to think of every possible emergency and who might provide a lifeline. However, it suddenly occurs to me that if I need to turn on this phone again, the shit will have truly hit the fan. I place the escape kit into my bag. I will hide it in the car when I get a moment.
 
As I hoist up the bag, ready to step out, a rush of feelings for Bella hits me like a wave. It stops me cold. Dropping the bag to the floor, I catch my breath. Her place in my life, our time together, feels more profound than anything I've known. Her imprint on my heart is so deep and fast it's staggering. My mind whirls with worries. Can my feelings for Bella steer me off course? Am I willing to gamble it all for her? Rico's words of distrust echo in my head - could I pull the trigger if I had to? Doubts creep in, shaking up my resolve.
 
I shake my head, trying to rattle loose those unwelcome thoughts. Ain't no room for distraction or doubt right now. So, I grab that bag again, square my shoulders and stride towards the door, hell-bent on keeping my mind on the job at hand.
 
I stop and put the bag down.
 
I walk over to a corner of the basement, swallowed in shadow. There, an inconspicuous wooden table sits, not seeming to do much. With a firm grip, I slide it aside, unveiling a secret trapdoor under it. There's a small, sturdy square of metal with a high-security keypad, camouflaged into the concrete floor, known only to a few trusted souls. The digits of the code are seared into my memory, and my fingers dance over the keypad. A soft beep lets me know I've hit it right, and I lift the door, unveiling the dark mystery beneath. Feeling around the hidden space, I find what I'm looking for. The chill of cold metal against my skin, a trusty Walther PPK. Compact, discreet, but packs a punch. I hoist up the gun, its familiar weight a grim comfort, and scoop up a spare mag of bullets. Also stashed away here is a holster, built for minimal show and maximum hold. A decisive click tells me the mag's snug in the Walther, a round in the chamber, safety on. The loaded gun finds its place in the holster, tucked away under my clothes.
 
A deep breath and I hoist that bag again.
 
Heading up the basement stairs, each groan under my boots echoes the jittery thrill coursing through me. No denying the stakes we're dealing with tonight. The air seems dense with pressure, and I gulp it in, trying to steady myself.
 
The polished banister under my grip is cool, and smooth, grounding me in the familiar. Walking down the corridor, I can't help but notice the portraits and art pieces on the walls, each stirring up a memory.
 
Pausing at the study door, I steal another breath before pushing it open. The room's lit with a warm, soft glow from the setting sun, casting long shadows across the polished wood. The familiar scent of leather and old books hits me as I step in, a welcome distraction, if only for a moment.
 
My gaze sweeps over the book-filled shelves, the well-used armchair, and the heavy desk, all bearing silent witness to hours of work and contemplation. As I tread deeper into the room, the weight of the concealed gun is a sobering reminder of the risks ahead. I spot Bella at my desk, her eyes fixed on her laptop. She's dressed for the job, all practical and no-nonsense. Her hair's swept up in a tight ponytail, showing off her neck's smooth curve and her gritted jaw. Watching her I'm struck by the beauty of her steely determination. The intense focus in her furrowed brow and the steady rhythm of her typing hands radiate a sense of resilience I've not seen in her before. This Bella, ready to meet head-on, whatever the night throws at us, is a revelation.
 
Her dark, form-fitting outfit and sturdy boots highlight her lean build, the well-defined lines of her muscles, and the effortless grace of her motions. Even on the brink of a dangerous mission, she has this captivating air.
 
Seeing Bella like this, all grit and gumption, adds another layer to the woman I've come to cherish. The sight of her stirs up a renewed belief in our partnership and the path we've chosen to tread together.
 
"Bella, time to hit the road," I say, eyes still on her and the laptop.
 
She gives a nod of agreement and shuts the laptop. "Alright, let me just gather my things." Her eyes dart around the room, checking she's got everything. She picks up a compact, black rucksack she'd readied earlier, tucks in the laptop and all other essentials she'll need for tonight. It's a sleek, unobtrusive piece, easy to carry and ideal for our job.
 
Bella slings the bag over her shoulder and rises from the desk, a steely resolve etched on her face. "I'm set," she says, looking back at me, her grit only reinforcing my trust in us.
 
Together, we step out of the study, making for the front door, each footfall bringing us closer to the pivotal moment. In the hallway, I pull Bella close, our lips meeting in a fierce kiss. As we pull back, I hold her gaze.
 
"Bella, there's something I gotta tell you before we dive into this," I say, my tone firm, unwavering. "Once the job starts, I call the shots. My feelings for you won't cloud my judgment or stand in the way of pulling this off. You gotta understand, I'll do whatever it takes to make this a success."
 
Bella's gaze locks with mine, her face reflecting comprehension and resolve. "I get it, Luca. I know the stakes are high. I'm geared up to do what needs to be done. I trust you."
 
“No Bella, I need you to understand.”
 
She looks at me, confusion flashing across her face. “Go on.”
 
“I will do anything that is needed.”
 
She looks at me for a moment and nods. “I think I understand what you are saying.”
 
“Good.” I turn and head out of the door.

## Title: 

The Heist: A Dark Mafia, Undercover Lover Romance (Undercover Obsessions Book 1)

For him, she would risk everything...



Today I risk everything for justice.

They think I am Bella, a spoiled Russian heiress, the daughter of a rich mafia boss.

But it's all a lie.

I am a police officer, operating undercover to bring a ruthless gang of art thieves to justice.

I never thought it would be easy, but no one told me it would be this hard.

My job is to trap Luca. He is dangerous and unforgiving. As a criminal, I should hate him and everything he stands for.

But...

How he looks at me leaves me feeling in a way that I have never felt before. Those eyes seem to see right into my soul. His touch leaves me aching for more.

As I learn more about Luca, I discover that you really canâ€™t judge a book by its cover. Sometimes a man is playing an act to survive in a dangerous world, and underneath hides something different.

I am a professional; I can do my job.

If I can't, then I will have to risk everything for this man.

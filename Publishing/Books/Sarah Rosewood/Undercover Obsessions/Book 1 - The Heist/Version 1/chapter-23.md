## Bella
 
I across the table at Luca. The soft light from the overhead chandelier casts a warm glow on his handsome features, and his eyes are filled with a softness that I've grown to find comforting and incredibly attractive.
 
The remnants of our sushi dinner are strewn across the table, the once neatly arranged platter now a scene of delicious carnage. My hand toys idly with the stem of my wine glass, the last of the 2018 Mosel Riesling Luca had brought up from his cellar swirling around the bottom. Much like Luca, the wine is a luxury I'm quickly developing a taste for. I had known very little about wine, enough to pass as a spoiled trust fund brat, but Luca had taken the time to teach me.
 
A small smile tugs at the corners of my lips as he jokes about something from our day at the zoo. Sitting here in this kitchen, it's strange how normal this all feels, despite our reality's chaotic undercurrent.
 
I have tried to push the mysterious text message to the back of my mind. It's a problem for later, one I need to handle delicately. But right now, I need to keep Luca unsuspicious. He's observant, more so than most men I've encountered, and it's important that he doesn't see anything amiss.
 
"I need to wash up," I say, breaking the comfortable silence that has fallen between us.
 
I can feel his eyes on me as I stand to clear the table. The thought sends a shiver and a sense of pleasure down my spine. Even amid this complicated situation, I can't help but find myself drawn to him, his confidence, and his charisma.
 
As I clean up, Luca leans back in his chair, his eyes pensive. He swirls the last bit of wine in his glass and takes a thoughtful sip. "I spoke with my father earlier today," he says, breaking the silence.
 
His voice is steady, but he's slightly on edge. I look up from the dishwasher, my hands pausing mid-action, a sushi plate half-loaded. "Oh?" I ask, trying to keep my tone casual.
 
"The owner of the manor, the one housing the painting, is going on a business trip to Paris soon. We've received confirmation that the house will be empty," he says.
 
The news is a shock, but I try to keep my face neutral. I had expected some warning, not this sudden news. However, I know we don't have the luxury of time. "When?" I ask, managing to keep my voice steady.
 
Luca shrugs. "A couple of days at most. We'll need to be ready to go at a moment's notice."
 
A thrill of anticipation courses through me. The heist is almost upon us, the mission we've been preparing for all this time. I take a deep breath, my mind racing with all the preparations we still need to finalize.
 
"Are you ready?" Luca's voice pulls me out of my thoughts. His gaze is fixed on me, his dark eyes serious. I can see a flicker of concern in them, but also a glint of excitement. He's just as ready as I am.
 
"I am," I reply with a small, confident smile. "I can go whenever we need to."
 
I see the relief wash over Luca's face, and an impressed and pleased expression replaces it. But his eyes say more - they tell me he's glad to have me by his side in this. And despite the danger we're about to face, I can't help but feel the same.
 
“So,” he says, “that treat I owe you from the zoo.”
 
“What treat?” I tilt my head and regard him with curiosity. "You owe me a treat?" I question, the words registering in my mind, along with the memory of our playful banter at the zoo. I can feel a blush creeping onto my cheeks, my heart pounding.
 
“Come here,” he says.
 
I walk towards him, feeling my pulse quicken with each step. He draws me into a hug as I reach him, his arms wrapping around me in a firm yet gentle grip. His breath tickles my ear as he whispers, "Let me look at you." The request is so soft, so intimate; I can't help but comply.
 
I step back, allowing his gaze to travel down the length of my body. I'm dressed in an oversized, soft sweater that hangs off one shoulder. A hint of my collarbone peeks out from the neckline, exposed to his gaze. My leggings are soft and loose, hugging the curves of my hips and thighs. I've pulled my hair up into a messy bun, strands escaping here and there to frame my face.
 
“You look beautiful,” he says and smiles.
 
“Thank you,” I say. He looks at me and we hold eye contact for a few seconds longer than is natural. I see his pupils are dilated, wide in his blue eyes.
 
“Remove your leggings.” His voice is soft but demanding.
 
I meet Luca's darkening gaze, feeling a thrill of anticipation running through me. My heart beats a wild rhythm against my chest as I reach down, my fingers hooking into the waistband of my leggings. I watch as his eyes follow my movement, the intensity of his gaze sending a shiver down my spine. I find his demands oddly thrilling. The idea that I am this man’s every thought and desire is exciting. I peel the soft fabric away from my skin. The room is quiet, the only sound is the rustle of fabric and our shared breaths. The leggings slide smoothly down my legs, revealing more of my skin to his heated gaze. I take my time, relishing the way his eyes seem to drink in every new inch of exposed flesh. It's a heady feeling, having someone look at you like that like you're the only thing in the world that matters.
 
The leggings pool around my feet, and I lift one foot and then the other to step out. With a casual flick of my foot, I kick them away, my focus entirely on the man before me. I watch as his gaze travels back up my body, a slow, appreciative sweep that leaves me feeling both seen and desired. The look in his eyes is one of pure admiration, and I can't help but bask in it, my skin tingling under his heated gaze.
 
“Now your top.”
 
I catch his eye, noting how they darken further as I reach down and pull at the hem of my oversized sweater. His gaze is almost palpable, a tantalizing sensation that makes the simple act of undressing feel far more provocative than it should be. With a slow, deliberate movement, I lift the sweater up over my hips, the fabric whispering against my skin. I draw it higher, over my stomach, and up to my chest. The warm air of the kitchen meets the newly exposed skin, causing a shiver of anticipation to run down my spine.
 
The sweater covers my face for a brief moment as I continue to pull it upwards. The scent of the fabric softener we use mingles with a hint of my perfume, a strangely comforting combination. I'm momentarily blind, but I don't need sight to feel his intense gaze on me, and the thrill of it quickens my pulse. I finally lift the sweater entirely over my head, tossing it aside with a nonchalant flick of my wrist. I lower my arms, letting them fall naturally to my sides, my body now bare save for the lacy bra.
 
“Panties.”
 
Still holding Luca's gaze, I reach for the waistband of my panties. My fingers slide under the soft material, feeling the lace against my skin as I take hold of them. It’s a small and simple garment, yet its removal feels significant, like an unspoken agreement between us.
 
I begin to inch them down, moving almost sluggishly, making each second seem like an eternity. My heartbeat rings in my ears, a steady rhythm that aligns with the slow descent of the lace. As the fabric slides down my thighs, over my knees and finally pools around my ankles, I feel a liberating sense of freedom. I step out of them, leaving them discarded on the cool kitchen tiles.
 
Standing in front of Luca, I am exposed under his intense gaze, yet there's a thrill in being seen and desired so intensely. His dark eyes burn with unspoken promises and I can't help but feel a sense of anticipation for what is to come.
 
Luca stands, steps towards me and kneels in front of me, his face just inches from my exposed pussy. There’s something about seeing this powerful man on his knees, almost worshipping me, that leaves me wet and excited. I feel like the most desired person in the world.
 
Luca places his warm hands on my knees, causing a shiver to run up my spine. His touch is gentle yet commanding, a contradiction that somehow fits perfectly with the man before me. His dark eyes meet mine as he speaks.
 
"Bella," he says, his voice low and rich with desire, "open your legs for me."
 
His words send a thrill through me. I swallow hard, a wave of anticipation washing over me. With him watching my every move, I slowly do as he asks. His hands assist me, guiding my knees apart until I'm exposed to him. His gaze is intense, yet there's a softness in his eyes. It's like he's seeing me - really seeing me - for the first time. I feel a connection between us that goes beyond the physical; it's as if our souls are speaking to each other. This man, who was once a stranger, is now the center of my world, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
 
He leans forward and I feel his tongue exploring my pussy. I am was already wet but now my juices feel like they are freely flowing. His tongue explores me, his hands pushing my legs apart, giving him better access. I feel him push against me, his whole face pushing between my legs. His tongue and lips sending spikes of pleasure through my body. As he licks at me, I can feel the tension building, the unmistakable start of an orgasm building.
 
He pulls his face away and lifts his hand. His finger fingers my clit and he rubs, soft circular motions. It's like he knows my body and can touch me in a way that instantly excites me. I gasp. I feel a tremor run through my legs. I gasp again as the sensation builds. He continues to rub, hard and deliberate.
 
I close my eyes. He removes his fingers and replaces them with his tongue. This time, he is more hungry, his tongue licking and pushing between my clits and the flaps of my pussy. He grips my backside, one hand on each buttock and pushes me into his face.
 
The sensation of pleasure is irresistible. The way this man is forcing my pussy into his face pushes me to the edge.
 
I gasp as the tension reaches a climax. He senses I am close and pushes in harder, licking faster, the motion not stopping, relentless spikes of pleasure firing through my body.
 
I cum on his face.
 
A squeal escapes my lips as the climax takes over my body. I feel my knees weaken and Luca grapes me harder, holding me in place. He slows and lets the waves of pleasure rock through me.
 
I look down and see this man on his knees before me. He is worshipping me, worshipping my pussy and my pleasure. He could have me any way he wished, any time he wished, yet he is on his knees, making me the center of his world. It's too much. I feel his tongue touch my clit and I cum again.

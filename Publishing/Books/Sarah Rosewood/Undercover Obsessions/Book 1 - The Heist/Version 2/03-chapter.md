# Chapter 3
## Bella

The evening air is still warm as I stroll up to the towering glass facade of the hotel. The building is an architectural marvel, a bastion of modern design encased in glass and steel, rising like a beacon in the darkening cityscape. 

A doorman stands near the entrance. He offers a warm, practiced smile as he holds the door open for me, his eyes crinkling at the corners in a genuine show of welcome. His formality lends an extra layer of prestige to the establishment, making it clear they prioritize their clientele's experience. I reciprocate his smile, pulling my suitcase along with the quiet hum of its wheels serving as my only accompaniment. As I glide through the doors, a world of understated opulence greets me. The contemporary decor is complemented by elegant furniture, each piece has been carefully curated and arranged with the precision. The lobby is expansive, its lofty ceiling studded with chic, low-hanging lights that cast a warm, inviting glow. The marble floor is a pristine canvas of ivory and gray, its polished surface gleaming under the diffused light, a mirror of the grandeur above.
 
As I approach the reception desk, the faint, pleasing aroma of fresh-cut flowers and lemon-infused polish wafts through the air, adding to the ambiance. The desk is a statement piece in itself, hewn from what seems to be a single block of Carrara marble. The receptionist is the epitome of professional elegance. Her sharp uniform complements her slender frame. She glances up from her screen, a picture-perfect smile playing on her lips. I square my shoulders, offering her a small smile.
 
"Good evening," I say. I extend a manicured hand towards her, resting it on the desk. The nail polish matches the color scheme of my outfit, a habit born out of my innate desire for coordination and control. The cool marble of the counter seeps through my fingertips, grounding me in the reality of the situation. "I have a reservation," I say, keeping my demeanor casual, a polite smile etched on my face. I remind myself that I am a Russian socialite with a rich gangster father. I have been frequenting places like this all my life. I let the persona flood into my body.
 
The receptionist, a young woman with an amiable smile, nods in response. "Could I please have the name for the reservation?" she asks, her tone professional and courteous.
 
I decide that my ‘alias’ wouldn’t want to converse with this lower receptionist more than required; she certainly wouldn’t want to speak her name in public like some common housewife on holiday in Benidorm. I retrieve my passport from my slim Givenchy clutch and hand it over to her. She takes it, her eyes quickly scanning over the details. A look of surprise crosses her face as she reads my name, but a practiced, neutral expression swiftly replaces it before entering the information into the system. A moment passes, then another. 
 
"Welcome, Miss Gordievsky," she says, her tone subtly shifting to convey deeper respect, her curiosity thinly veiled. "You're in our penthouse suite." She slides a keycard onto the desk. I take it.
 
As she nods, a bellboy appears, uniformed in a crisp tailored suit that mirrors the doorman's. With an effortless grip, he lifts my suitcase, his friendly smile never wavering. "This way, Miss Gordievsky," he chimes.
 
Following the bellboy with an unhurried pace, we traverse the plush carpeted corridor. The walls are covered with sleek marble tiles, portraying a delicate blend of earthy tones, and their crisp modern lines are adorned with art pieces that make it feel more like an intimate gallery than a hotel corridor. Ambient lighting casts an inviting aura, the play of light and shadows painting a picture of a luxury cocooned away from the city's noise.

As we approach the lift, the soft thud of my Valentino Rockstud heels against the carpeted floor harmonizes with the quiet hum of the hotel's comings and goings. With a professional flourish, the bellboy presses the call button for the elevator. The doors slide open, revealing a capsule of understated elegance. It's all brushed stainless steel and shimmering mirrors, bathed in the soft glow of recessed LED lighting—the ceiling dotted with an array of miniature stars. Our reflections in the mirrored walls seem to multiply us, and I can't help but feel like I'm in a scene from a high-concept art film. Stepping inside, the bellboy remains in stoic silence, maintaining an air of professional detachment, his gaze directed at the illuminated panel of floor buttons. He presses the one marked 'PH'. There's a subtle lurch as the elevator begins its ascent, its gentle hum permeating the otherwise silent space.
 
Stepping out of the elevator, we find ourselves in a more intimate corridor, a modern oasis of tranquility marked only by two doors. A short walk takes us to the one marked with a subtly placed 'PH'. The bellboy reaches into his pocket and produces a slim, silver key card, which he slides into a discreet slot by the door. With a soft click, the door unlatches, inviting us into my private sanctum. There's a brief pause as the bellboy steps aside, holding the door open for me with a formal tilt of his head. I glide past him.
 
The room is a vision of contemporary elegance, a portrait painted with clean lines, tasteful decor, and luxurious comfort that takes my breath away. I turn to the bellboy, still standing respectfully by the door. He hands me the key and I take it. I reach into my clutch and pull out a crisp note. As I hand it over to him, I'm rewarded with a slight widening of his eyes.
 
"Thank you," I say.
 
With a nod of acknowledgment, he takes the tip. "Enjoy your stay, Miss Gordievsky," he replies, his voice a quiet echo in the grand room before turning on his heel and leaving me alone.
 
As the door closes behind him with a definitive click, I step further into the room, my heels sinking into the plush carpet. The penthouse suite unfolds like a masterpiece. I stand at the entrance for a moment, drinking in the sheer opulence of it. Sleek modernity melds seamlessly with lavish comfort, creating an atmosphere of extravagant elegance that's as intoxicating as it is inviting.
 
The living area, awash in soft neutrals and punctuated by tasteful artwork, spans the length of the suite, anchored by floor-to-ceiling windows that offer an unparalleled view of the cityscape below. A plush, charcoal grey, L-shaped couch occupies the center of the room, angled towards a state-of-the-art flat-screen television mounted on the opposite wall. On the far side of the living area, a sleek black marble countertop demarcates the kitchen, complete with gleaming stainless steel appliances and high-end fixtures. Tucked away from the living area, I spy a glass-top dining table set for two beneath a modern chandelier. The warm glow of the lights reflects off the polished surface, illuminating the pristine white china and sparkling crystal stemware. To my left, a corridor leads to the suite's private quarters. But the pièce de résistance has to be the private balcony, its sliding glass doors teasing the spectacular view outside. I'm drawn, pushing the doors open, I step onto the spacious balcony, the cool night air kissing my face. The city below twinkles with a thousand lights, an enchanting vista of life and excitement. 
 
I turn and make my way to the bedroom. I flop onto the bed. The crisp, high-thread-count white linens feel cool and smooth against my skin. The generous duvet, perhaps filled with goose down, is inviting, promising warmth and comfort. The pristine white cover is embroidered with intricate silver patterns that catch my eye. I reach out to touch it, and the fabric feels as luxurious as it looks.
 
I exhale deeply, letting all the tension drain from my body. Closing my eyes, I focus on my breathing, drawing in the cool, filtered air of the room. With each breath, I can feel the tightness in my chest loosening, and my thoughts drift away. I feel an overwhelming sense of calm, a tranquility I haven't felt in what seems like ages. 

The gentle hush of the room fades into the background as my thoughts wander. My mind is drawn back to the meeting with Harrison. I recall the steps echoing the crisp sound of shoes on the polished floor. I remember the glances from the uniformed men as I walked past. Amidst the sea of faces, one particularly stands out in my mind's eye. I craft an image of a man—traditionally handsome with sharp features and a square jaw, exuding an undeniable air of confidence. His blue eyes, intense and probing, seeming to look right through me. His uniform fits him just right, hinting at a well-maintained physique underneath. He holds himself with elegance, the effortless authority of someone who knows their worth and place in the world. I can hear his voice, deep and commanding but with an underlying warmth.
 
As I lay there, I allow my thoughts to wander further.
 
He approaches me, his stride confident yet not imposing. I can feel the heat emanating from him as he draws near. Our eyes lock, and everything else disappears into the background. His strong hands reach out, enveloping mine. His grip is firm, reassuring. Every nerve ending in my hands tingles at his touch, sending little electric jolts up my arm and straight to my heart. He searches my eyes, tilts his head and leans in. Our lips meet softly at first, then with growing intensity. The world around us blurs as the sensation of the kiss becomes the only thing that matters. His lips are warm and inviting, moving against mine with a perfect balance of urgency and tenderness. The slight stubble on his chin brushes against my skin, adding a tantalizing roughness to the softness of the kiss. And then there's his scent - the unmistakable aroma of his aftershave. It's a complex blend, woodsy and slightly musky, with a hint of citrus that makes my head spin. It's masculine and comforting, wrapping around me like a protective cocoon. The fragrance seems to seep into my very being, making the entire experience even more intoxicating.
 
I pull away, the need for air becoming pressing. As I open my eyes, I'm met with his, still filled with intensity and desire.
 
Lying on my back, the soft embrace of the luxurious bed linens caressing my skin, I feel an urge for liberation. With a delicate touch, I gather the fabric of my skirt, drawing it upward. The smooth texture of the fabric slides effortlessly against my skin. Pausing for a moment, I appreciate the contrast: the elegant black knickers against the pale hue of my skin, a symbol of refinement and elegance. They're beautiful, no doubt - an expensive indulgence that I had allowed myself during a rare moment of self-pampering. Made of the finest silk with delicate lace trims, they are as much a piece of art as an article of clothing.
 
Taking a deep breath, I hook my fingers around the edges, carefully sliding them off. The feeling of freedom is immediate as if I've shed an invisible weight. The cool air against my skin feels exhilarating. I let my hand drift to between my legs, my fingers brushing my swollen clit.
 
My mind drifts back...
 
As the man's memory resurfaces, the kiss's nature changes. No longer is it gentle or tender; now it's filled with an almost overwhelming intensity. There's an urgency in the way his lips move against mine, a fire that seems to ignite with every touch.
 
His hands, once gentle, are now more assertive, more demanding. They explore with a hunger, grasping at the fabric of my clothes as if trying to claim every inch of me. Each touch and caress sends shivers down my spine, filling me with excitement and trepidation.
 
I allow my fingers to move faster, rubbing my clit, the unmistakable sexual tension building in my body. My muscles tense as the feeling starts to build.
 
I see the man again, feel him. 

He is part animal now, panting to contain his passion. 

His hand moves up my body; his long fingers circle my neck. I can feel the pressure; a slight panic rises in me. He leans in, his breath on my cheek. His lips almost touch my ear. He squeezes. I imagine the feeling as my airway is restricted.
 
He speaks.
 
“Cum for me, my little slut.”
 
The orgasm explodes through my body. I arch my back as I lose control and pleasure washes over me. I let the pleasure sweep through my system for a moment, enjoying the sensation of being lost. It floods away. 

I relax and close my eyes.
 
My phone's ring breaks the stillness. The screen lights up with a familiar name - 'Dad'. A soft sigh escapes me as I pick it up, a hint of a smile gracing my lips as I swipe to answer the call.
 
"Hello, Dad," I greet, my voice a practiced blend of affection and nonchalance.
 
On the other end of the line, I hear a chuckle. "Nice to see you're not breaking cover," Superintendent Harrison says. Though slightly distorted through the phone, his voice still carries that distinct tone of amusement that I've known since childhood. “Not sure I like it when you call me Dad though.”
 
“You’ll get over it,” I say.
 
"Alright, Bella," Harrison's voice comes through the phone, business-like and brisk. “Are you OK? You sound out of breath.”
 
“I am ok, I was just doing some… er… exercise.”
 
"Ok, I'll keep this brief then. Things are moving faster than we anticipated. The timeline has been advanced."
 
I feel a jolt of adrenaline at his words.
 
"What's the update?" I ask, keeping my voice steady.
 
"There’s a meeting planned for tomorrow morning," he replies. "I'll send you the address. Bella," he pauses, and I can almost see him, the lines on his forehead deepening as he frowns. "You are expected to show up to start the planning. Are you ready for this?"
 
The question hangs in the air, charged and heavy. I take a deep breath, my gaze sweeping over the luxurious suite. "Yes," I reply, my voice carrying a determination that belies the twinge of nerves in my stomach. "It's better to get this started. The sooner we wrap this up, the sooner I can come home."
 
There's a moment of silence. "Good," he says, and I can hear the pride in his voice. "Stay safe, Bella. And remember, you're not alone in this. I’ll let you get back to your exercise."
 
The call ends, leaving me in the silence of my penthouse suite.

# Chapter 9
## Bella
 
The diner's door swings open before us, releasing a rush of warmth and aroma of coffee into the cool morning air. Luca holds the door open for me and I step into a bustling hive of activity. Waitstaff weave through tightly packed tables with practiced grace, their trays loaded with piping hot plates of food. The interior is a blend of the modern and the homely, clean lines softened by cushions and drapes in earthy tones. The walls are adorned with artful black and white photographs of what I assume are local landmarks. The wooden floor is worn smooth by countless feet, and the ceiling-high windows allow the early morning light to fill the room with a soft, welcoming glow.
 
I stand there, soaking in the ambiance, while Luca scans the room. He straightens, his gaze locking onto something across the room. I follow his gaze to see Rico, seated at a corner booth, his attention focused on the steaming mug of coffee in his hands. Luca gives my arm a light squeeze, a silent signal that we should move forward, and together, we begin to navigate through the early morning crowd.
 
We maneuver our way through the busy diner. Rico is hunched over a coffee cup, steam wafting off the dark liquid, even seated he is a formidable sight. His head is shaved, his clean-shaven face marked by sharp, rugged lines that speak of a life not easily lived. His piercing brown eyes are unnerving, seeming to see past the surface to your very core. He wears jeans, worn but fitting perfectly to his solid build, and a simple T-shirt, its fabric stretched over his muscled torso. Over this, he's thrown a leather jacket, its worn texture hinting at its age and use. We sit and Rico grunts in recognition of our presence. 
 
The waitress approaches our table. She's in her mid-thirties. Her hair is bundled into a messy bun, a few loose strands framing her face. Her apron, smudged with the day's fare, somehow enhances her friendly, approachable aura. 
 
"What can I get you folks this morning?" she asks in a voice that's as warm as her demeanor.
 
"Coffee, please," I respond, my request echoed by Luca. Rico shakes his head, seemingly content with his steaming cup of dark coffee.
 
The waitress retreats to fetch our order and a hush descends upon our little corner of the diner. The murmur of nearby conversations and the occasional clatter of dishes from the kitchen fill the void, the atmosphere teetering on the edge of discomfort. I let my mind drift back to the car ride over. Luca had been quiet, almost moody. His silence hung in the air like a thick fog, his brooding gaze fixed on the road, his mind clearly preoccupied with thoughts he wasn't sharing. He is an enigma wrapped in a riddle and I'm not sure where I stand with him, which is unnerving. I know I have to tread lightly, maintain my professional distance. The waitress returns, a tray balanced in her hand. Setting down our coffee with a practiced ease, she flashes us a quick smile before returning to the bustle of her duties, leaving us alone once more in our bubble of uneasy quiet. Turning my attention back to the table, I watch Luca shift in his seat and clear his throat.
 
"Let's get down to business," he announces, his tone firm, his gaze sharp.
 
Luca pulls out a map from a slim folder he's been carrying, laying it flat on the table between the cups of coffee. He starts pointing out locations on the map with the tip of his finger, his focus completely engrossed in the matter at hand. "See here," he says, his finger tracing a route along the streets of the city, "this is the main route we'll take to get in. Me and Bella will use my car, inconspicuous, blends with the traffic. False plates of course."

Rico nods. "Of course."

Luca points to a building marked with a small 'x'. It seems to be nestled in a small wooded area. "You, Rico, will park here." 

Rico nods. "Already scouted the area. Its the perfect spot to remain hidden."

Luca's finger moves to a lane marked with a circle. "This is where I'll leave the car." He shifts to a large building. "Me and Bella will make our way on foot to here. If we run into trouble," he moves his finger to a series of interconnected lines, "these are our possible escape routes. Make sense? I know this isn't new information."

I nod. Luca has already been over this with me. "All good," says Rico. 

Luca's finger returns to the x. His eyes flicker up to meet ours, ensuring we're following along. "Rico will be waiting here. Far enough away to stay out of sight but close enough to get involved if the shit hits the fan."
 
He turns his attention to Rico, who's been sipping his coffee. "What do you think?" His question hangs in the air for a moment, followed by a tense silence. 

Rico grunts and crosses his arms. He fixes his gaze on Rico. "What's wrong, Rico?"
 
"Nothing," Rico grunts out, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
 
Luca shakes his head, his eyes never leaving his. "We've known each other too long for you to lie to me, man."
 
Rico seems to be wrestling with himself in a moment of silence. "Fine. You really want to know?"
 
"Yes," Luca confirms without hesitation, "I do."
 
Rico sighs his face a mixture of frustration and annoyance. "Fine," he says, his gaze darting towards me. "It's her." 
 
"For fuck's sake, Rico, I thought we dealt with this yesterday.” Rico looks at Luca and they lock eyes. “OK. What about her?"
 
Rico's eyes narrow. "I don't get why we have to fucking trust her. Am I the only one who thinks this is all a bit fucked up? She rocks up from God knows where and moves in with you, making herself at home. She could be filth for all we know." His voice grows louder.
 
Luca's jaw clenches, his eyes taking on a hard look. "You know the score, Rico," he retorts. "My father has vetted her. He trusts her, therefore, we trust her." His tone is threatening now, the warning clear.
 
Rico's fists clench at his sides, his voice raising in pitch. "And now she’s sitting here and we're discussing the final details of something that could get us locked up for a long time. It's not right," he exclaims. “You know that just planning this is a crime, right?” His voice is barely a whisper, but the zone is harsh.
 
I am impressed. I had assumed that the finer points of criminal law would be wasted on a brute like Rico, but once again, he surprises me and I realize I have underestimated him again. That’s twice. I vow there will not be a third time.
 
Luca stares at Rico, his cool demeanor contrasting sharply with Rico's heated outburst. "Look, man, this is not your call to make. If you're not happy, you can always walk."
 
Rico shoots up from his seat, all eyes in the diner now on us. "You're not my boss, Luca," he shouts, his nostrils flaring.
 
Luca remains seated, his eyes drilling into Rico. "Yes, I am." Luca's voice is calm and measured. The tension in the air is palpable. I find myself holding my breath, watching the exchange between the two men. Luca rises from his seat and confront Rico, I can't help but feel a jolt of fear. His commanding presence fills the room, tension crackling in the air like static electricity. The diner has gone silent.
 
"My father says she's okay," Luca asserts in a hiss, his gaze unyielding as he meets Rico's glare. "That should be enough for you. However, I say she's okay and that IS enough for you. If you have a problem, now is the time to say. What about it, Rico? You got an issue?"
 
Rico holds Luca's gaze for an uncomfortably long moment, his anger palpable. He breaks eye contact and slumps back into his seat, the fight leaving him. "No, I don't have a problem," he mumbles, not meeting anyone's eyes. “Boss.” The word is a dripping with emotion.
 
"Good," Luca replies. The room springs back into chatter. He draws in a deep breath, and for the first time since this confrontation started, I find myself exhaling. "Now, let's all calm down."
 
The waitress returns at that moment, her brows furrowed in concern. "Everything okay here?" she asks, her gaze darting between us.
 
"Everything's fine," Luca assures her with a friendly smile. “My friend here was insisting that The Rolling Stones are a better band than The Beatles. I was explaining to him that he was mistaken. He’s now started to see the error of his ways.” Luca smiles. She nods, turns and walks away. Luca's attention returns. "Rico, I understand your concerns, but your job is to keep us safe, not to worry. That's my job. So until Bella gives you a reason to think otherwise, you treat her like one of the team."
 
Rico gives a curt nod. Luca glances between us, his gaze resting on me a moment longer than necessary. "I think it might be better if we continue this later." 

"I agree," says Luca. 

He gathers the map, folding it and sliding it into his folder. He places money on the table, way more than is needed to cover the coffees and stands. I follow stand leaving Rico seated. For a moment, we make eye contact and a chill runs through me. I turn and follow Luca. As I trail behind, I struggle to process what just happened. Luca – Luca, of all people – has just stood up for me. For a moment, I let that sink in. The guy who always seemed to put himself first defended me against a known killer. I glance at his back, my mind whirling with a new perception of him. For all his aloofness and detached persona, there was a force I hadn't seen before, a raw assertiveness that had just roared to life in my defense.
 
I hadn't expected him to come to my aid. Not so openly. Not so... fiercely. But he had. And I have to admit, it was... attractive.
 
My heart pounds as we leave the diner. The morning sun was already beginning to heat up the pavement, and I blinked against its brightness, my mind still spinning from the revelation of Luca's unexpected defense.
 
My eyes travel over Luca as he strides ahead of me, his broad shoulders set with an air of authority that now seems so much more appealing. His casual attire – a simple black shirt tucked into dark jeans – did nothing to hide the lean muscles that moved with an easy grace under the fabric. I admire how his dark hair catches the sunlight, creating a halo of soft light around his head. Heat rises in my cheeks as I realize I'm ogling him – this man who I'm supposed to be working with, not fantasizing about. But I can't help it. The events in the diner... they've changed something. I feel an unfamiliar pull, a sudden intrigue I can't ignore. It's not just his physical attractiveness, which is undeniable, but the strength of his character that had revealed itself back there. The way he stood up for me, his uncompromising assertiveness, it was... compelling.

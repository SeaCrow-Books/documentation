# Chapter 17
## Bella

The velvet darkness of the room presses down on me like a thick, soft blanket. The stillness is nearly palpable. The bed is my refuge, a cocoon of soft sheets and warmth. I feel a shift beside me. The faint rustle of fabric. Luca. The weight of his arm, resting on my waist, moves, and his fingers graze the curve of my collarbone. I believe it's unintentional, perhaps just a reaction to a dream or some distant thought, but the intimacy of that touch makes me hyper-aware of every point of contact between us.
 
His breathing is even. Each exhale is a warm whisper against the nape of my neck, contrasting sharply with the room's cool air. I resist the urge to lean back into him, to seek more of that comforting warmth. I feel him stir. A soft murmur escapes his lips, words lost to sleep, and he draws me closer, his arm anchoring me to him. The gesture is protective, instinctual, as if even in sleep, he's determined to keep the world at bay and keep me safe.
 
I sense movement behind me. The mattress dips, accommodating Luca's shift in position. His warmth envelopes my back, his body contouring to mine in a perfect, familiar fit. The sensation is comforting, like two puzzle pieces finding their rightful places. His arm snakes around my waist, pulling me closer, and I can feel the even rhythm of his breathing against the back of my neck. I relax into his embrace, allowing his presence to lull me into a sense of security. His fingers brush against the inside of my wrist, a simple yet intimate gesture that sends a shiver down my spine. In these silent moments, nestled close in the dark, I truly understand the depth of our connection. Luca has conveyed a world of emotions without uttering a word – safety, comfort, love. And as the boundaries between our bodies blur, I let the reassuring weight of his presence guide me into a deep, restful sleep.
 
My eyes flicker open as a gentle shift in the mattress alerts me to Luca's awakened state. My back to him, I feel the warmth of his chest pressed against mine. A soft warmth creeps up from my core, spreading to my fingertips and toes. The realization dawns upon me - I'm emotionally stirred and physically aroused. I feel a warmth in my pussy and I know I am wet. Just the thought of this man is enough to arouse me.
 
A vivid image plays before my closed eyes: the soft press of Luca's lips to the nape of my neck, trailing up to the sensitive spot just below my ear. The imagined touch sends a tingling shiver down my spine, awakening the butterflies in my stomach. I imagine him deepening the contact, the weight of his body atop mine, the sensation of him within me. The thought alone leaves me breathless, yearning for a connection that transcends the physical, a merging of souls.
 
I'm already a storm of thoughts and feelings, and Luca's subtle shift only stokes the fire. The undeniable hardness pressing against my lower back sends a jolt through me, a sharp, electrifying pulse of awareness. Every nerve ending becomes acutely sensitive to his proximity.
  
It's hard to keep my breathing even and pretend I'm not affected by this intimacy. It would be so easy to give in to these thoughts, to let them carry me away. The memories of his past encounters fill my mind — stolen glances, lingering touches, passionate nights. The raw, electrifying energy between us is an entity of its own, and it's always been there, simmering beneath the surface even when we've tried to deny it. I remember how his hands feel on my skin, strong yet gentle, exploring every inch of me. The sensation of his lips, hot and insistent, trailing a path of fire down my body. The feeling of complete surrender, of losing myself in him.
 
The gentle glide of Luca's fingers down the curve of my spine ignites a trail of sensations, each one more intense than the last. It's like a soft murmur of promise, a whisper of things to come. My breath catches, the subtle arch of my back responding to his caress. The warmth of his body radiates through the fine fabric of our nightclothes, yet the thin barrier feels like a chasm that both beckons and challenges.

Pushing back slightly, my body molds into his, the perfect fit. His arm tightens around my waist, pulling me closer as if trying to merge our two beings into one. The unmistakable rhythm of his heartbeat against my back reassures me, as does the deepening cadence of his breathing. In this intimate embrace, I'm on the verge of surrendering.

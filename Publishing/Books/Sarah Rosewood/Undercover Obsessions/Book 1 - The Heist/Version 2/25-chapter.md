# Chapter 25
## Bella
 
Luca woke me early. His hard penis poking into me before I had even opened my eyes. It's like he can’t get enough of me. I feel that I am constantly filled with his seed. Honestly, I am a little sore. My buttocks still hurt from his belt and I am still in a little pain from where he penetrated me from behind. I had never had sex like that before. I wanted to say no, to stop him, but I was powerless against his desire. And… well, I enjoyed it. I am embarrassed to admit it and it makes me feel like a slut but I like being used by him. I have never known a man with so much passion.
 
The steady drumming of the shower in the background is a reminder of his presence. I picture Luca under the spray - strong, toned, his body wrapped in tendrils of steam as he washes off traces of our passion. The potent and vivid image sends a flutter of want coursing down my spine.
 
Enveloped in plush sheets, a rare moment of tranquillity settles over me - until the reality of the text message slams back into focus; my pulse quickens, a wave of dread washing over me, causing my stomach. I force myself to breathe, to think rationally.
 
What's the reality? What do I know?
 
My burner phone is missing, but they'd call a Soho restaurant if they dialed the only stored number. So it's unlikely they've uncovered my real identity.
 
I slow my brain and force myself to think logically.
 
What do they know?
 
I have a secret phone.

That's it.
 
I breathe deeply.
 
Yes, if I was an undercover police officer, then that’s the kind of thing I’d have. However, it's also true that if I was from a rival gang, risking my life to steal a painting, I might also have a backup phone.

Also, if I was the real Bella, its not beyond comprehension that I would have a secret phone as a type of back up.
 
Breathe Bella, think.
 
If whoever sent the message thought I was a police officer, they would have killed or snitched on me.
 
Or… 

They are waiting to use the information for their gain. 

Breathe.

But...

The possession of the burner phone raises questions, but it doesn't necessarily point to my undercover status. They can't go around accusing people of being police officers with some solid evidence. They type of behaviour is dangerous in this world. People have to move with caution. They're probably playing a game, attempting to flush me out.
 
But who's behind this? 

It could be anyone - they all had access to my room. A horrifying thought flashes across my mind - could it even be Luca? It feels unlikely... unimaginable.
 
Can I really trust him? Is Luca truly on my side?
 
I close my eyes and think.
 
Vittorio would have stormed down the stairs, phone in hand. He'd have confronted me and probably bundled me in a car and buried me in the woods. He’s impulsive. So it's unlikely to be him.
 
Bianca is selfish and manipulating, but all she cares about is power. If she knew, she’d be unable to resist telling Vittorio and use me as a pawn for some bigger game.
 
Luca… I shake my head. Luca? No. Could he do that to me? I shake my head again. If I have to trust one person, it would be Luca.
 
Which leaves Rico.
 
The muted rhythm of the shower cuts off, the abrupt silence replaced by the soft rustling of a towel. Luca reappears, his only garment a towel slung low on his chiseled hips. His skin glistens with the remnants of the shower, droplets clinging to his muscular form, twinkling in the morning light. His hair, tousled and damp, adds an irresistible allure to his handsome features. However, worry tinges his striking emerald eyes as they find mine.
 
"You alright?" he questions, the depth of his concern echoed in his tone. He traverses the room swiftly, every line of his tall, athletic build radiating an inherent masculine confidence.
 
I nod. "Yeah, I'm okay."
 
He scrutinizes my face for a few more moments, his gaze piercing through me. A gentle smile graces his lips as he tucks a stray lock of my hair behind my ear, a simple act that sends a jolt of warmth cascading down my spine, emphasizing our potent connection.
 
The chirp of his phone breaks the moment. He scoops it off the nightstand, scanning the incoming message. The easy warmth that permeated the room moments ago dissipates, replaced by palpable tension. His gaze flickers towards me, filled with a flash of indecision before he exits the room, the door clicking shut behind him.
 
My heart hammers against my ribcage as I strain to catch fragments of his muffled conversation. I can't decipher the words, but the urgent tone is unmistakable. Time stretches, seeming like an eternity, until the door swings open again, revealing Luca with a clouded, serious expression. Deep in thought, he stands motionless before his voice slices through the silence.
 
"We need to chat, Bella," he intones, his voice firm yet filled with a gentle undercurrent.
 
"Luca, what's happening?" I manage to squeak out, my tone barely a whisper.
 
Drawing a deep breath, his gaze holds mine. "We're moving out tonight, Bella. The operation is a go. We're meeting at the warehouse in an hour."

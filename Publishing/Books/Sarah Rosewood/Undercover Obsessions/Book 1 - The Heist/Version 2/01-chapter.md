# Chapter 1
## Bella

I have always tried not to care but this place always makes me feel like I stick out. My street clothes—faded jeans and a loose black hoodie—form a vivid contrast against the sea of dark police uniforms. 

The structure pays homage to brutalist architecture. The stark white walls stand erect, towering towards the high ceilings, their austerity unrelenting. My footfalls reverberate against the cold, rigid floor. Life hums around me; officers everywhere are engrossed in their duties, with some huddling in clusters amidst animated discussions while others chip away at mountains of paperwork or peak at computer keyboards. Several officers stop to stare as I walk past.

I tread a familiar path. The stark corridors twist and turn at harsh 90 degree angles, leading me to a solid wooden door. The name 'Superintendent Harrison' gleams on the metallic nameplate. An uneasy knot tightens in my stomach. A summons to Harrison's office is not commonplace. It suggests either a severe misstep on my part or a monumental task at hand. Swallowing the rising tide of anxiety, I take a deep breath and remember that I am a professional. 

I knock on the door and wait.

“Enter,” says a muffled voice. I push open the door.

Harrison sits amidst the organized chaos of his desk, a symbol of his long history in this job. Towering stacks of paperwork, a testament to countless solved cases, take up much of the surface. Amidst this mess sits a decades-old desk lamp, its light harsh and unflinching. A coffee-stained mug balances on the lip of the desk. Scattered framed photographs show a younger Harrison during a more innocent time, a fiery spark undimmed in his eyes. Sitting behind the desk, the man seems the picture of composure laced with fatigue. His combed back, greying hair accentuated the lines etched deeply on his face from years of late-night stakeouts and relentless investigations. His stormy blue-grey eyes hold a glimmer of the past but carry the weight of countless experiences. He looks up and motions for me to sit. Despite the strain visible on his face, he smiles.

"Good to see you, Bella. You're looking well. Everything okay at home?"

I nod. "I'm good, thank you.”

He pauses. We sit, listening to the muffled sounds of the building’s activity floating through the door. “I spoke to your mother a few weeks ago.” He takes a long breath. “She seems… okay,” he adds, seemingly sifting through his thoughts for the correct words.

“Yeah,” I say. “She likes her new place.” I let the silence fill the room for a moment. “Superintendent, I'm eager to know why I'm here. What's the urgent matter?" I keep my tone professional.

“All business as always,” he says with a smile.

Harrison reclines in his chair, his fingers woven together. "Bella," he starts, his eyes intent on me, "do you recall Van Gogh's painting, 'The Poppy Flowers'?"

His reference to the painting catches me off guard, but I rack my brain for tidbits. It feels strange that my art history studies might actually become relevant. "Yes," I answer. "It was stolen, right?"

A nod confirms my recollection. Harrison's fingers tap a silent rhythm on the desk, filling the silence as he speaks. "Twice, actually. Both times from a museum in Cairo. The first theft was in 1977, but it was recovered ten years later. The second time it disappeared was in 2010."

My eyebrows knit together in confusion. "Why does this stolen painting matter to us now, sir? Do you have a lead?"

Harrison leans forward. "Six months ago, an anonymous tip-off reached us. A British aristocrat claimed to know where the painting was located. He expressed interest in buying and donating the artwork to the National Gallery. Not sure why he was overcome with national pride, though it sounds more like guilt to me. However, he added a condition – he didn't want to be prosecuted for theft or handling stolen goods. He’s not admitting any wrongdoing; he just doesn’t fancy a stint in jail for doing what he sees as his patriotic duty. We don’t think he’s the thief, just a middleman. Anyway, he’s got links high up in the government and pots of cash. You know how these things work, we’d never get a conviction to stick, even if we wanted to."

Silence stretches as the unexpected twist takes a moment to register. "And we agreed to that?" I ask.
 
A nod from Harrison confirms it. His face is stern. "We made a deal. Seems our bosses are open to deals these days if it means they can tie up loose ends or hook a bigger fish. So, nothing to lose. It's a win-win. He gets the good press; we recover a stolen work of art."

“What kind of deal?”

Leaning back into his chair, Harrison's arms fold across his chest. "Ever heard of the Vella gang?" His question hangs in the air, punctuated by the ticking of the wall clock.

I shake my head. "No, I can't say I have. Should I?"

"No, there’s no reason you would have. The Vellas are a small family gang—mostly into art crime these days. But don't let that fool you; they've been on our radar for several years now. We suspect them of being involved in major thefts, but we've never been able to pin anything on them. They are very careful. Couple of jobs a year with big payouts." Harrison has a grave tone as he talks, a hint of worry barely discernible beneath the seasoned calm.

I sit on the edge of my seat. "And you think this Vello gang is involved? Tell me more. Who's in charge?"

"The boss is a man named Vittorio Vella, originally from Sicily," Harrison explains. "Rumors hint at extensive connections, both in Sicily and here. He’s probably mafia, or at the very least, under mafia protection. He's a tough one, not easily swayed or intimidated. Definitely the kind of guy that you need to tread carefully around. He's also slippery, it hard to get anything to stick to him. With the legion of expensive lawyers backing him, any case against him must be airtight."

I can feel the implications of Harrison's words starting to settle in.

"And there's more," Harrison continues, gazing at me. "His son, Luca, is also heavily involved in the gang's activities. He seems to be the real brains behind the operation. A few years ago, there were rumors that he was looking to branch out into cybercrime, but nothing came of it. Though Luca is interesting its his father that is the real target. If we can get Vittorio then the whole house of cards will come tumbling down." Harrison leans back in his chair, clearly working up towards something. "We've been working on building a case against the Vellas for years," he says, his gaze piercing. "If I am honest, it's become a bit of a personal obsession of mine. I’ve been monitoring Vittorio for as long as I can remember. He’s slipped through my hands too many times. With my retirement looming, I'm itching to put this scumbag behind bars.” He stops and looks up, his expression betraying his realization that he’s said too much. “Well, anyway, we have a plan in place now."

“Go on.”

"The generous aristocrat has agreed to display the 'missing' Van Gogh in his mansion," he explains, making air quotes around 'missing'. "Of course, he'll display an impressively accurate forgery. Setting all this up has taken ages; we’ve had a forger working on the painting for months. A guy called John Myatt.”
 
My eyebrows shoot up. “Ohh, I’ve met him.”
 
“Really?”
 
“Yeah, a few years ago. He was part of a job; he helped to identify a forgery. A family thought they had an original Gauguin; Myatt was part of the team that proved it was a fake.”
 
Harrison smiles. “Yes, I remember now. Not one of mine, though. Myatt’s setup is impressive. Trust me; this fake is convincing. It will stand up to a casual inspection, even from an expert."
 
His words spark a mixture of intrigue and excitement within me.
 
"That's not all," Harrison says, a glimmer of excitement entering his eyes. "About six weeks ago, one of our undercover officers approached Vittorio. The agent was posing as a Russian mafia boss interested in European art. The Vella gang has a reputation, so this wasn’t anything unusual. Our guy explained that they had learned about the Van Gogh coming out of hiding and explained that he knew where it was to be displayed.”
 
“Clever,” I say.
 
“Yeah, I thought so too. Our guy explained to Vittorio that it was unsafe for the Russians to come to Britain, considering the current political climate. They would be watched from the border, which is no way to snatch a famous painting. He told Vittorio that he had heard of his previous work and wanted to bankroll him to steal the painting. The deal was that the Vella gang would grab the painting and then sell it back to the Russians at a price lower than the black market value. Our guy laid it on heavy, telling Vittorio he was the only person that could do the job. Appealed directly to his vanity. Vittorio fell for it. The Russians would fund the operation in return for a knockdown price. Win-win."

I couldn't help but admire the audacity of the plan. It was playing right into Vittorio's ego, and the promise of a hefty profit would be too tempting for him to resist. Stealing a famous painting was often the easy part of the deal; finding a buyer for such a unique item was the real skill. It wasn’t a surprise that Vittrio couldn’t resist.
 
"They have already agreed on a price, and the theft is set to take place in the coming weeks," Harrison says, satisfaction evident in his voice.
 
"And where do I fit into all of this?"
 
Harrison's gaze is steady on me. "We need someone on the inside. Someone to ensure that evidence is gathered properly and everything goes according to plan. I can't risk this being another botched job and Vittorio getting off on a technicality. If we can pick up Vittorio and Luca in the act, then we will have enough to link them to other jobs." I nod. "Our Russian mafia boss insisted that he would only fund the theft if one of his 'security experts' were involved in the operation," he continues, using air quotes again. "Vittorio was hesitant initially, but when the Russian threatened to pull out of the deal, he reluctantly agreed."

Confusion furrows my brows. "All sounds solid but there's one problem I don't speak Russian, and I certainly don't have a Russian accent."

Harrison chuckles. "Your backstory is that you grew up in London after the fall of Communism. You are a brat from money. You have never set foot in Russia and saw more of your nannies than your Commie relatives."

I let out a soft laugh, shaking my head in disbelief. "OK, seen plausible but I barely know anything about tech," I admit, running a hand through my hair. The idea of posing as a tech expert is daunting.

"That won't be a problem; the Vella gang doesn't know anything about this stuff either," Harrison assures me. "We'll provide you with a laptop full of fake tech. We have had a real security expert working on creating the software over the past few months. Remember, the theft will be staged, so all the alarm and security systems will be fake. They'll be disabled on the day of the operation. You will just need to hit a button, the software will beep and flash. It will look like you've worked some hacking magic. We’ve done this before; it's very effective."

Despite his assurances, I can't shake off my nagging worries. The plan seems too convoluted, too fraught with risks.

"Trust me, Bella, we've thought of everything. All you have to do is play your part convincingly."

His words are meant to be comforting but do little to quell the knot of unease tightening in my stomach. It's one thing to be told everything is under control, but quite another to believe it fully. I know just how quickly these types of operations can turn bad. Despite my reservations, I know I have no choice but to trust Harrison and hope his plan works as smoothly as he believes it will.

Harrison dives down to rummage through one of the desk drawers, emerging with a small thumb drive. He extends it towards me, the tiny piece of tech glistening under the harsh office light. "Everything you need is on this," he states. "Go home and study the information."

I take the thumb drive from him, turning it over in my fingers, its weight barely noticeable. Suddenly, the room feels incredibly small, the enormity of the task pressing in on me from all sides. I look up at Harrison, my voice barely above a whisper. "How long do I have?"

"A few days, perhaps a week," he replies, a hint of sympathy in his eyes. "There are still a few things that need to be put in place, but be ready to go."

A few days to become a Russian mafia boss's daughter and a tech expert. A few days to prepare to infiltrate a notorious art crime gang. A daunting task indeed, but it's my job. The job I have signed up for, and despite the nerves and the fear, I know I have to see it through.

"It's not all bad," he says with a smile. "We've booked you a five-star hotel in the city center. You'll live the high life, just as a Russian mafia boss's daughter would." He pauses for a moment, giving me a significant look. "This is where you'll be based while the robbery is organized, and it's also the first step in selling your cover story to the Vellas."

The news of a luxurious hotel stay does nothing to diminish my overwhelming responsibilities, but I give Harrison a determined nod. I must focus on what's important—maintaining my cover and gathering evidence against the Vella gang. The comforts of the hotel room will be just that—comforts, not distractions. 

"I understand, superintendent," I affirm, the grip on my resolve tightening. "I won't disappoint."

Harrison's gaze finds mine again, his voice taking on a somber tone that makes my heart clench. "Bella," he begins, his stern eyes not leaving mine. "This job is more dangerous than any you've taken on before." The gravity of his words hangs between us, leaving no room for doubt. He leans forward in his chair, creating a connection that feels almost tangible in its intensity. "The Vella gang... they're not just petty criminals. We believe they're killers." He pauses as if contemplating what to tell me. "I am convinced he’s a killer." He sighs. "Vittorio’s wife disappeared under mysterious circumstances some years ago. Luca was just a kid at the time. It was investigated. I was on the case, just a sergeant. It was the first time I crossed paths with Vittorio. We suspected he had killed her, but we had no evidence. She just disappeared. There was never a body. We looked but could never find anything. We even questioned Vittorio, but with nothing but circumstantial evidence, we had to let him go. I can still see the smug bastard’s face as he strutted out of the station. That’s just one example. If they discover your true identity, your life will be in immediate danger."

His words echo in the silence, each feeling like a cold drop of rain, chilling to the bone. Yet, despite the risk, I know I have a duty to fulfill. I swallow hard. The risk might be pressing down on me like a heavy cloak, but my resolve remains unshaken. As I take in Harrison's stark words, I feel a familiar stirring within me, a thrum of adrenaline that quickens my pulse. The thrill of the chase, the allure of danger, is like a siren's song, pulling me in with its intoxicating melody. 

On a deeper level, this assignment gives me a chance to put real criminals behind bars and make a difference. It's why I joined up. I have always known the dangers that come with the job. And yet, there is a quieter voice, a small, prudent whisper that nudges at my consciousness. It speaks of caution, of the importance of safety and self-preservation. It paints vivid pictures of worst-case scenarios, each more terrifying than the last. I could end up in a situation far beyond my control. If discovered, I might be at the mercy of ruthless killers. 

Control has always been important to me. I think it’s how I process emotion and keep the dark thoughts at bay. I can’t allow my world to be chaotic; I need to have some level of control. Yet, even I can admit that, at times, the constant need to keep things from breaking away from me and spiraling out of control is exhausting.

Looking Harrison in the eye, I nod. "I understand, Harrison. But I'm prepared to take that risk."

Harrison's eyes convey a deep understanding, bringing an unexpected lump to my throat. "Your father would be proud, Bella," he says, the words striking a chord within me.

"I... I believe he would be," I reply, trembling.

“I know that you have never really gotten over his murder, but there was nothing you could have done. You were only a kid.”

“I know,” I say. I pause, feeling the tears well up. “He knew the risks.”

“But I understand,” the superintendent says. “You might not be able to get justice for his murder, but this helps in its small way. I get it. This work is important to you. It's why I suggested you for this case; the fact you have a master’s in fine art did help, though.” He smiles, but it soon falls away.

“Thank you,” I say.

There's a moment of silence as we hold each other's gaze.

“But Bella, you know it will never be enough, right? You know that no matter how many criminals you put behind bars, that need will keep nagging away. It won't bring your father back.” I know he’s right. I know it will never be enough, but I don’t know what else to do. Harrison coughs and looks away. "You need to go upstairs to see Stella," he says. "She has your 'undercover kit' and is expecting you."

“I like Stella,” I say with a smile.

“We all like Stella,” he says, matching my smile.

I stand up, tucking the thumb drive safely away. I nod at Harrison, a silent promise, before stepping out of the office and towards whatever lies ahead.

I take a deep breath as I exit the sanctuary of Harrison's office. Making my way up the stairwell, I notice the architectural severity slowly tapering off, replaced by a more lived-in, worn-down feel. In stark contrast to the cold, sterile modernity of the lower floors, this area of the building clings to its past with stubborn tenacity. Once clinical white, the walls now appear as though they're wearing a patchwork quilt of greying blots and water stains, each marking the passage of time like rings in a tree. The fluorescent lights here are less imposing. Their illumination is subdued, casting dim light and long shadows that twist and dance along the hallway. This distinct shift from the omnipresent brightness that dominates the lower floors creates both a comforting and slightly foreboding atmosphere.

Stella's office is a forgotten nook tucked away in this quiet maze. It truly seems the definition of organized chaos. Two desks are crammed into an ungenerous space, both vying for territory amidst a jungle of old files, antiquated computer hardware, and oddball tech gadgets. One desk is deserted, its surface a barren landscape in stark contrast to its neighbor. Stella, occupying the other desk, is an unassuming woman in her early thirties, almost invisible amidst the office clutter. Her plain, mousy hair is cut in a neat bob, her face framed by a pair of sensible glasses that give her an air of studious intensity. Dressed in a simple jumper and jeans, she blends into the chaos like a chameleon adapting to her environment. The lack of ostentation doesn't make her any less formidable, though. There is something truly captivating about her, a quiet dedication that seems to hum around her.

The moment Stella spots me, her face lights up in a warm smile. She rises from her chair and embraces me, her arms welcoming and comforting. We have been through so much together, and every time I see her, it feels like a homecoming. But as quickly as the warmth fills the room, it evaporates, replaced by Stella's focused, business-like demeanor.

"Bella," she says, "I have something for you."

She searches around the room, shuffling papers and moving items in her hunt. I watch as she weaves through the chaos of her office with a surety that is both mesmerizing and amusing. After some rifling, she finds what she is looking for. An open cardboard box, seemingly nondescript amidst the clutter surrounding it. A sticky note affixed to the side, bearing the words 'Vella Case' in Stella's neat handwriting, is the only clue of its importance. Stella retrieves a thick manila folder from the box, noticeably bulging with documents. She hands it over to me.

"These are the hard copies of all the digital information Harrison should have given you. Just in case you prefer the old-school method. He gave you a pen drive, right?" I nod. “Good.”

She returns to the box and pulls out a sleek new smartphone and a charger. "This," she says, holding the device up, "has been loaded with all the apps someone in your supposed situation would have. Make sure you take some time to familiarize yourself with them." I nod and take the phone.

Stella's hand dives back into the box, her fingers riffling through the various contents. From the depths of the box, she pulls out a sleek laptop—a beautiful piece of technology with a gleaming, obsidian surface. Accompanying it is a charger, its black cord coiled thick and robust, hinting at the power that would flow through it.

"This," she starts, cradling the laptop with almost reverent care, "is your key to success." The lights overhead cast reflective streaks across the surface of the device, making it shimmer with an air of clandestine sophistication. "Our resident tech wizard, Dave, from IT, has loaded it with all the software you could need." She places the laptop in my hands. "You'll have a video chat with him later, and he'll go through everything in detail. Make sure you know how to navigate the labyrinth of digital deception we've installed there."

The next item she retrieves from the box seems nondescript at first glance—a small, simple, black object. But I know better. It is a burner phone, small enough to fit into the palm of my hand, yet I can sense its heavy implications.

"And this, Bella," Stella's voice is uncharacteristically grave, her gaze sharp and piercing, "is your lifeline in the abyss." The tiny phone feels like it weighs a ton as I accept it from her, the sheer magnitude of its purpose dawning on me. "It's got a single contact—a quaint Russian restaurant in Soho. If the worst comes to pass, dial the number, request 'the table by the kitchen for 8 p.m.’ and use the name 'Gordievsky.' They are part of our network—they'll connect you to me immediately. Otherwise, it will appear as a mundane dinner reservation. But," she pauses, reinforcing the urgency of her words, "this is to be used in dire situations only."

Stella's eyes do a final sweep across the empty expanse of the cardboard box that once housed my undercover equipment. "I believe we've covered everything for now, Bella," she remarks, a glint of solemnity replacing the enthusiastic spark in her gaze. She straightens her glasses, her gaze meeting mine. "We'll have a proper sit-down and a thorough catch-up once this job is over, alright?"

I find myself nodding, my agreement automatic, my hands tightening around the sleek contours of the laptop now entrusted to me. As I turn to leave, I cast a backward glance at Stella. She is already swallowed up in the whirlwind of her office, her slender figure becoming almost invisible behind the haphazard piles of paperwork and tech gadgets. I pause for a fleeting moment, absorbing the surrealism of the situation, before stepping out of her office.

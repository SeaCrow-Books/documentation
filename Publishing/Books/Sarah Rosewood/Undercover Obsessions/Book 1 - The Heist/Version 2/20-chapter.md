# Chapter 20
## Luca
 
The room is awash with a dusky glow from the light outside peeking past the closed curtains, its warm hue punctuating the stillness. I'm nestled into the plush pillows, an untouched newspaper spread across my lap. Adjacent to me, Bella is lost in her literary world, a book cradled in her slender hands. My eyes trace the contours of her form. The muted light catches the outline of her collarbone, the rhythm of her breathing causing a steady rise and fall of her chest, an irresistible invitation to touch. 

My thoughts drift to Bella's punishment. It plays like a reel in my mind, each moment sparking a visceral reaction. I've shared my bed with submissive women, who were all too willing to bend to my will, but it always felt like a game. Bella was different. The ease and speed with which she surrendered, without questions, without resistance... it was intoxicating. It was as if she was peeling away layers of herself, revealing a raw, unspoiled canvas that only I was privy to. Her obedience was so immediate, so absolute; it was like she was made for me. Yet, at times I could see the spark of a fight, a moment where she wanted to resist. It just added to the excitement. Knowing that despite her deeper thoughts, she felt she had to submit. 
 
A potent mix of satisfaction and excitement coils within me at the thought of it. My heart thumps in my chest, a throbbing echo of the rush that floods my veins. Bella had given herself to me like no woman had before. So completely. I'm thrilled and eager to explore this newfound dynamic between us. I'm hungry for more.
 
Bella's voice, a soft murmur against the quiet, pulls me back from my thoughts. "Luca, are you tired?"
 
"Not really," I reply, breaking my gaze from her to the newspaper on my lap. "Just thinking."
 
A pause fills the air. "Do you treat all of your girlfriends this way?"
 
I can't stifle the chuckle. "Bella, I've never really had a girlfriend." I pause, choosing my words. I am unsure why, but I don’t want to upset Luca. I am never normally bothered but this stuff and pride myself on brutal honesty, even if is ploughs headlong through a woman’s feelings. "There have been women, ones I've used purely for sex, others I've regularly slept with, and a few I thought I might trust enough to tolerate in some kind of relationship, but never anything like this, like what we have."
 
Our eyes lock, hers mirroring a strange cocktail of shock and solace. She scrutinizes my face as though seeking validation for my words. “What do we have?”
 
I pause. Good question. “I… I don’t know. All I know is that it feels different, that I like it, and I want more. I feel the desire to protect you and keep you safe.”
 
She smiles. “I like that.”
 
I smile back. “Good.”
 
Bella looks away as if deep in thought and then looks back. "So, how many women have you slept with?"
 
"Really, Bella? You want to go there?" I ask, an eyebrow arching in surprise.
 
She nods, an unwavering resolve in her eyes. "Yes, I want to know."
 
I run a hand through my hair, sighing as I do. "I am not sure you will like the answer.” I look at her and nods. “Ok. Honestly, I don't know."
 
"You don't know," she echoes, her frown deepening, "or you don't want to tell me?"
 
I shake my head, meeting her gaze. "I'm not keeping a tally, Bella. It's just... too many. Lost count."
 
Her eyes widen, a small ‘oh’ escaping her lips.
 
I look at Bella, her eyes filled with curiosity and concern. "I've never tried to hide my past from you."
 
"I know," she replies, her gaze meeting mine. "But I have to ask... have you ever had sex with one of those women in this bed?"
 
“Fuck Bella. Really?” I shake my head.
 
“Please,” she says, “I want to know.”
 
"OK, truth?”
 
“Yes, the truth.”
 
“No. No, I haven't, as it happens."
 
Bella's eyebrows raise in surprise. "Why not?"
 
A moment of anger flashes through me. Does she think I am lying? I have been nothing but honest with her. “You don’t believe me?”
 
“I believe you, but it seems strange that if you have fucked so many women why have you not pleasured them in this bed.”
 
I hesitate for a moment, trying to find the right words. I am unsure if she’s mocking me or genuinely interested. But I want to be honest with her. I have avoided these types of conversations in the past, but there’s something different with Bella. It's like I want to be the best version for her. "I've always gone to a hotel for those encounters. That way, I can leave when it's over.”
 
She seemed surprised. “When what’s over? The sex?” I nod. There’s a moment of silence. “Why leave?”
 
Her questions annoy me, but strangely, I want to be honest with her, even though it makes me look like a twat. I feel she deserves that from me. It’s a new feeling for me.

“Honestly? To avoid the small talk and all the fake romantic shit. No unnecessary emotional entanglements. It's easier that way."
 
“Easier for who? You or them.”
 
I hesitate. This is a good question and something I’ve never even thought about. The honest answer is that I am selfish and that once I have used a woman, I have no interest in them. There’s nothing more they can offer me. Most of the women I fuck are stupid with little to offer beyond fake tits and tights asses. More than once, I have heard them complain that I only went them for sex; that’s true, but the reality is sometimes that is all they have on offer.
 
“Me.”
 
Bella seemed to digest my words. “And no ‘fake romantic shit’? What like this?” she says, spreading her hands wide to indicate my bed.
 
She seems upset. "Well, yeah, I suppose this is romantic."
 
Bella looks at me, her eyes searching for answers. "Do you want me to leave?"
 
I pause, considering her question. "No, I don't want you to leave. I like this... us. Please, stay."
 
Bella's face softens, and a smile graces her lips. “Thank you Luca.”
 
“Sir,” I say. My face serious.
 
Her face drops. “Sorry. Sir.”
 
I smile. “I was joking, that’s for the bedroom only. In normal life you don't call me sir.”
 
She hits me in the arm with her book. I smile back at her. This is new to her and she is still learning the rules. I make a mental note to be clearer in the future. Yesterday was partially my fault, but it also a chance to test if she was playing or truly submissive. It is my role to give clear instructions. I don’t want there to be confusion. She must understand what I want, how and when I want it. That way any punishment is due to her willful behavior, not a mistake or misunderstanding. The punishment becomes part of the game. I must earn her submission each day; it is a gift and not something I take lightly.
 
"Show me your arse," I say. Bella hesitates. I can see that she is trying to second guess, unsure it if was a demand. “It wasn’t a request. I want to see it."
 
She looks at me for a moment. "Alright, just don't make fun of me."
 
She rolls over onto her front. She is only wearing black knickers and her red cheeks are clearly visible. The hand marks are fading quickly but the belt marks are red and angry. My cock twitches. I have branded her. She is my property.
 
I can’t help but let out a small laugh. "You look like one of those baboons with the red arse."
 
Bella looks at me with a puzzled expression. "Baboons? What do you mean by that?"
 
"You know, those monkeys with the red arses. Their butts are all swollen and red, just like yours." Her confusion persists. "You must have seen them. They are normal monkeys but with a huge red arse.”
 
“You are pulling my leg.”
 
“No, honest.” I smile. “You must have seen them at the zoo."
 
Bella's eyes widen. "I've never been to a zoo."
 
I stare at her, astonished. "What? Really? You are fucking with me. How have you never been to a zoo?"
 
She shrugs. "My family never really did things like that. We never went on outings like going to the zoo."
 
"That's so surprising," I say, shaking my head. "I thought your dad was some high-ranking gangster. How did he never take you to the zoo?” Confusion flashes through my mind. How is this possible?
 
Bella pauses. She lets out a long breath, hesitating. “Growing up, my dad was never there. He was always out working and my mum was too busy doing God knows what. I was closer to my nanny. My Dad didn’t like us going out. He said it wasn’t safe.” 
 
I nod. “I see.”
 
“Then I was set off to boarding school.” She smiles. “Think Hogwarts without the magic.”
 
I smile back. “Sorry, I never realized.” I am not sure what she means by 'Hogwarts' but feel now isn't the time to ask.
 
“Don’t get me wrong; I never needed anything material. I always had more money than I could have wanted, cash showing up each month in my account, often from a place or business I didn’t recognize. I know it's weird, but I knew my dad was always thinking about me.”  
 
Bella goes quiet. I have pushed her too far. I feel bad. I want to make her feel safe and protected, not remind her of the bad times.
 
I smile at her. “I feel like everyone goes to the zoo at least once."
 
"Well, I haven't." Bella looks away, folding her arms across her chest.
 
"Alright, it's settled,” I say.
 
“What’s settled?”
 
“Tomorrow, we're going to the zoo."
 
Her eyes light up with a mix of surprise and amusement. "Are you serious?"
 
I nod, grinning. "Absolutely. It's about time you had your first zoo experience."
 
Bella laughs. "I can't believe we're going to the zoo just because of my baboon-like butt."
 
“I just hope they don’t think you are an escaped monkey and call the cops.”
 
She springs up, a huge smile on her face. “You are cheeky.” She grabs the pillow and hits me across the head.

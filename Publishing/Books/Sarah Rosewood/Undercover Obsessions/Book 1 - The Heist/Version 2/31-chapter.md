# Chapter 31
## Bella
 
Our ride is a quiet one, the inky blackness outside wrapping around us like a shroud. The glow of the dashboard casts ghostly shadows across Luca's rugged face, our silence painting a thousand words as the miles fall behind us. My mind whirls with the weight of our situation. My world's been upended, my future is uncertain. But there's a glimmer of hope, a beacon in the dark - I'm no longer alone. Having Luca by my side, someone willing to brave the storm for me, gives me the courage to face whatever's coming.
 
Luca's voice shatters the silence. "This situation is far from ideal." He's angry. 
 
"Yeah, you're right," I whisper.
 
He lets out a long breath; it sounds like resignation like he has no choice. “OK, this is fucked up, it's dangerous and scary. Rico will not hesitant to kill either of us. I know him. If he feels trapped he will attack and ask questions later.” He glances at me and back at the road. “Listen. We've got one shot. Rico's expecting you alone, and he'll be armed. He always it. Always. But he won't see it coming when you spill the beans."
 
"Yep, you're spot on."
 
"Rico's a cold-blooded killer and a brawler, but often he's short-sighted. He's not one to foresee every angle. Planning isn’t his strong point; he is reactive, not proactive." His eyes flit to mine, a storm of concern and determination brewing within. "We've got to be cautious, Bella. Rico's a wild card. Unpredictable, lethal. He will not hesitate to kill you and I doubt he’d even think twice about putting a bullet in me if the situation calls for it."
 
I swallow the lump in my throat. "I understand," I reply, my voice shaky. 
 
"I am not sure you do, but we are out of options." Luca falls silent. We ride in silence for a few minutes. I look across to see an intense expression on Luca's face. "Alright, here's the plan," he says. "You go in first, alone.”
 
“What? He’ll shoot me on sight.”
 
“Perhaps. It's a gamble, but it's the painting he wants, not you. He’ll be focused on that. His exit strategy will be to escape with the painting. He'll only kill you if he has to. He might be ruthless but he's not a fool. He's knows a dead body will attract the attention of the police. Plus, if he knows you are a copper, he'll not want that kind of extra attention if he can get away with it. Your only chance is to get him talking. He’s never been good with women; they make him nervous. He never knows what to say. You will be able to buy some time. This might be enough to give us an edge. You need to appear vulnerable and feminine. Do you understand?"
 
“Yes,” I say, “I can do that.”
 
“You must show your fear. He must see you are scared.”
 
I nod in agreement, trying to quell the fear gnawing at my insides. "And then?"
 
"Then I'll follow. He won't be expecting me. He’ll not have considered the possibility that you confessed to me and survived. He’ll not see it coming. We'll blindside him."
 
I draw in a shaky breath, trying to latch onto his unwavering conviction. "What about us, Luca?" I barely manage to whisper, dreading his response. “You can't go back to Vittorio after this."
 
“I’m aware,” he says, his gaze steady. “I have made my choice, this is my new reality. You are my new reality.” He looks at me, a smile flashes across his face, and he returns to the road. “What about you? Can you go back to your superior?”
 
“I hadn’t considered that.” Luca is right; what can I do? I am trapped. I should be running away, but I can’t just abandon Luca. I also can’t turn him in, not now. “I can’t imagine you in prison, Luca.”
 
A flicker of vulnerability crosses his gaze, replaced by his steadfast determination. "No one is going to prison. We'll work it out, Bella," he reassures, his voice rock-solid. "One step at a time. Right now, we need to get through this."
 
I nod, swallowing the lump in my throat. "You're right," I say, forcing a small smile. "We'll face this together and then deal with whatever comes next."
 
Luca squeezes my hand. I feel a surge of strength and determination flow through me.
 
Luca studies the sat-nav, his brow furrowing in recognition. "We're heading to an old industrial park," he informs me, surprise tingeing his tone. "I recognize this place. I am sure my father owns a unit there. We'd used it as a chop-shop for stolen cars back in the day. I haven't set foot there in years."
 
A silence settles between us, pregnant with tension, as the car hurtles down a dual carriageway, a streak of light in the urban night. Eventually, Luca peels off onto an exit, the car's momentum tapering off as we merge into a main road. The familiar sights start fading, replaced by unknown territory, feeding the unease gnawing at my insides. Our surroundings take on an ominous air as we navigate into the industrial park. Giant, brooding warehouses flank the narrow road, their looming presence casting long, dark shadows. Sparse streetlights create a dance of shadows on the dilapidated concrete and graffiti-marred walls, lending an eerie, almost spectral quality to the place. 

We edge further into the park, our headlights slicing through the darkness. Each warehouse we pass seems more forsaken and deserted than the last. A shiver ripples through me at the thought of what could be lurking at the end of this desolate stretch. I try to regulate my racing heartbeat, reminding myself that I'm not alone - Luca is with me, and together, we'll face whatever waits for us.
 
My attention is snagged by a dim light seeping from a dirty window near a warehouse's entrance. The warehouse is a nondescript structure built from aged brick and corrugated metal. Its chipped paint gives way to rusty patches and decay. In front of the building, a pair of large, weather-worn metal doors, their padlocks hanging useless and broken. Discarded crates, pallets, and old machinery lie in a chaotic sprawl around the exterior, partially shrouded by the encroaching vegetation slowly claiming this abandoned spot. The air carries the acrid scent of oil and mildew, marking the years of neglect this place has seen.
 
The gravel crunches beneath the tires as the car comes to a halt. The sound reverberates in the otherwise hushed surroundings, and the car's headlights cast long, spectral shadows on the ground, enhancing the warehouse's intimidating aura.
 
"Step out here so Rico can't spot me," Luca instructs.
 
Summoning my courage, I inhale and swing the door open. 

The cool night air wraps around me, sending a shiver coursing down my spine. Clasping the bag I approach the towering metal doors. The gravel protests underfoot. The faint buzzing of electricity from within the warehouse tinges the air, and the low light casts uncanny, dancing shadows, heightening my sense of trepidation. Hesitating, I cast a glance back at Luca. He remains in the car, his gaze trained on me. I acknowledge him with a nod, which he reciprocates, his face a blend of resolve and worry.
 
Swiveling back to the door, I swallow hard and reach for the cold metal handle, its chill triggering another shiver.

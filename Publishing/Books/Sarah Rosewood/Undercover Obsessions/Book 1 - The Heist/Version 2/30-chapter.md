# Chapter 30
## Luca
 
The dim light of the car makes Bella's deep brown eyes sparkle as she looks at me.

"What Bella?" I ask. "Can this not wait?"
 
She shakes her head and looks away.
 
"Luca," she murmurs, a tremor in her voice. "Listen, please, it's important. I have something to tell you."
 
“What is it?” I ask.
 
She looks at me. “I love you."
 
Her words hit me like a punch to the gut, leaving me speechless, my mind scrambling to make sense of what she just revealed. A surge of joy mixes with disbelief in my heart. I never expected to hear these words from her, least of all now, in the aftermath of our audacious heist.
 
“I… I,” I stammer.
 
"There's more, Luca. There's something else I need to tell you, and I need you to listen."
 
Her voice carries a note of grave seriousness, and I see fear flickering in her eyes. A sense of dread washes over me.
 
"Please, Bella," I urge, my voice breaking with the intensity of my emotions, "tell me what's happening."
 
I observe her closely as she seems to mull over her words. She takes a deep breath and locks her eyes on mine, seeking reassurance or perhaps trust.
 
"Luca," she says, her voice barely above a whisper, "I need someone to trust. It has to be you. I need to trust someone. Can I trust you with anything, truly anything at all?"
 
My response is immediate and certain. "Yes, Bella, of course," I say. "You can trust me with anything. I promise. But do we need to go into this right now? We need to get moving."
 
She scrutinizes my face as if trying to measure the depth of my sincerity. Exhaling, she seems to arrive at a decision. "It has to be now," she murmurs. "I must tell you something, but you must promise to remain calm and hear me out before reacting."
 
A palpable wave of tension fills the air and my heartbeat accelerates. Despite the creeping sense of anxiety, I nod in agreement, providing her with the assurance she requires. "I promise, Bella. Just let me in on what's happening."
 
Tears shimmer in Bella's eyes and she inhales a trembling breath. "Luca, I've misled you. I'm not the person I claimed to be."
 
A chilling sensation sweeps down my spine and my stomach clenches in dread. My mind races, trying to make sense of her confession, but I force myself to stay composed and continue listening. “Go on,” I say.
 
She takes a deep breath. There’s a moment of silence. "I'm an undercover police officer," she says, her voice shaking. "My job was to infiltrate this operation, to gather intelligence, and take down Vittorio."
 
Her words hit me like a punch in the gut and a flood of emotions sweeps over me: shock, disbelief, a sense of betrayal. I wrestle to maintain my composure, remembering my promise to let her speak.
 
She looks down and then back at me, tears filling her eyes. "However, things changed," Bella says, her voice no more than a whisper. "I fell for you, Luca. And now, I can't stand the thought of betraying you, of putting you behind bars. I'm lost."
 
Her confession spins my world off its axis, leaving me grappling with everything she divulged. My heart throbs at the thought of losing her, yet the sting of her betrayal is sharp. Anger bubbles up, and I can no longer suppress it.
 
"How could you, Bella? You've deceived me, us all. We trusted you," I roar. “Rico was right. He tried to warn me, I should have listened to him from the start. I protected you, stood up for you, fucking trusted you. When all along you were planning to fuck me, my family and my friends.”
 
Anger washes over me. My hand finds my gun. I draw it from its holster. Despite the PPK's relatively small size, it feels heavy in my grip. Bella's eyes widen in terror. She dissolves into tears, the moisture streaming down her cheeks in rivulets.
 
"I'm so sorry, Luca," she sobs. "I never intended for any of this. I didn't mean to hurt you."
 
My hands tremble, and I can feel the frantic pounding of my heart in my chest. I should be incensed, I should end this deception with a bullet. 
 
"Please don't kill me," she pleads.
 
As I point the gun at Bella. The muzzle is just inches from her eyes. One pull of the trigger it all ends. My eyes flick to barrel of the gun, it sways as I try to hold it still. I start to squeeze the trigger, the pressure increasing. I glimpse the fear in her eyes, the vulnerability she had been masking behind her self-assured exterior. My mind spins into overdrive, and I feel trapped in conflicting emotions. How could she have betrayed me so? Yet, my feelings for her remain just as potent. A deluge of words and realization crashes over me.
 
I promised to protect and keep her safe.
 
Fuck.
 
Fuck.
 
I love her.
 
Fuck.
 
My thoughts tumble, filled with memories of shared laughter, fervent passion, and a connection unlike any I have ever experienced before. I reflect on her radiant smile, her warmth, the way she ignites a spark within me, and my anger gradually ebbs away.
 
I come to realize that I can't bring myself to hurt her, to erase the woman I love from my life, even if she has deceived me. My hand starts to quiver, and I lower the gun. Bella's eyes go wide, her breath comes in short gasps, and she exhales a sigh of relief.
 
"I won't kill you, Bella," I say, my voice a cocktail of pain and love. "But you owe me a full explanation. We have to navigate this maze together."
 
Tears gleam in her eyes as she nods in agreement.
 
"But we need to get out of here," I suggest, reaching for the ignition.
 
"Wait."
 
"What?" I turn to look at her.
 
Bella inhales, her tear-filled eyes fixated on mine, shimmering with determination. "There's one more thing, Luca," she murmurs, her voice trembling. "It's... It's something that could change everything."
 
My heart hammers against my ribcage, and I steel myself, bracing for the worst. “What? Speak up.”
 
“I’m being blackmailed. I think they plan to kill me.”
 
“What? Who’s doing this?”
 
"When I arrived at your place, I had a burner phone. It was an emergency lifeline, a way out if things went south. I hid it in my room. But someone discovered it. That night with the dress, when everyone was around. Now, they’re blackmailing me, Luca. They’ve threatened to expose everything to Vittorio if I don’t hand over the painting."
 
My fists clench as her words hit me like a ton of bricks. The thought of a traitor within our group, within our very home, kindles a blaze of fury within me.
 
"Who could it be?" I growl, my voice reduced to a dangerous whisper.
 
"Rico," she mutters. "It has to be him."
 
Rico. That makes sense. It explains a lot. It explains the way he has been. But why would he not just tell me? What is he planning? The mere thought of him betraying us sets my blood on fire. Bella should be the object of my rage, too, but all I can think about is shielding her from harm, ensuring her safety.
 
Bella retrieves her phone and glances at the screen before raising it to show me a text message. My eyes scan the screen, absorbing the critical information. A postcode.
 
"What is this?" I question, my voice layered with confusion and worry.
 
"It's the meeting location," she explains, her voice quivering. "The blackmailer wants me to bring the painting."
 
So that’s it. It’s all about money. After everything we have done for Rico, he’s prepared to betray it all for money.
 
Fucking pathetic.
 
I inhale, grounding myself and focusing on the challenge before us. I need to stay strong for both of us. I can't allow my emotions to cloud my judgment, nor can I deny the potent connection between us. 
 
“We need a plan," I declare, my voice steady. “Rico is a very dangerous man.”

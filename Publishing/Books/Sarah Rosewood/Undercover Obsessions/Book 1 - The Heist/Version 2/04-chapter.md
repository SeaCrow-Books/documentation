# Chapter 4
## Luca
 
The evening light fades behind the opaque blinds of my study, painting my world in somber hues of dusk. Mahogany bookshelves line the walls, each one bursting with volumes of literature, legal tomes, and historical accounts – the collected wisdom of generations at my fingertips. A plush, oversized armchair upholstered in aged burgundy leather sits to one side, my preferred spot for reading when time allows. On the opposite side of the room, an abstract painting, bold in colors, adds a modern touch to the otherwise traditional room. A polished mahogany desk commands the center of the room, my laptop perched atop it. My fingers tap on the keys, the soft clicking sound slicing through the thick silence of the room. The monotonous dance is broken by the unanticipated trill of the doorbell echoing through the hallway. I push away from the desk.
 
Padding my way to the hallway, I move amidst a gallery of art pieces, each holding a unique story. I reach out, turning the brass handle of the heavy door.
The heavy wooden door creaks open, revealing the figure of my father standing on the threshold. He is a portrait of a man in the twilight of his life, his glory days well behind him. Once a striking man in his prime, time has been an unforgiving artist, sketching lines of age, worry, and excess onto his once handsome features. His hair, a diluted shade of its former dark vitality, is carefully combed over to disguise the inevitable victory of time. The top has started thinning, leaving only wisps he artfully arranges each morning. His face carries the bloated puffiness of years of heavy drinking, a canvas of late nights and overindulgences. Once muscular and taut, his body is now thickened by years of rich food and abundant wine. He adorns himself in finely tailored suits. His ties are made of silk, their colours complementing his outfits. His shoes are polished leather, their gleam a testament to meticulous care.  What strikes me most are his hands. They are large and battered, a map of scars and callouses. 

"Father," I say. "Come in." I motion, stepping aside. His once powerful stride has diminished into a slower, more measured gait.
 
I guide him through the richly adorned hallway. As we traverse the familiar path towards the kitchen, I can't help but feel a strange anticipation knotting in my stomach. It's an unusual time for my father to pay a visit. 
 
Once inside the kitchen, I gesture to one of the stools at the counter.
 
"Drink?" I ask.
 
"No, thank you, Luca." His voice is gruff, lined with a lifetime of smoking and shouting orders. He declines the stool, opting to remain standing, his hands resting on the counter's cool surface. "I won't be long. I wanted to talk face to face." His eyes, the same deep brown as mine, meet my gaze. “It's about the meeting tomorrow. I wanted to chat without Rico and Bianca getting involved.”
 
"Alright," I respond, mirroring his seriousness. I lean against the opposite counter, arms folded, focusing on my father.
 
Vittorio's dark gaze never leaves mine, a glimmer of something unreadable in his eyes. "I don't trust this new woman," he starts, his voice dipped in the rawest form of honesty. "There’s something fishy about the whole set.” He pauses and lets out a long breath. “But we don't have the luxury of choice right now."
 
I nod. "I agree," I respond. "We need to be vigilant. More so now than ever. Until we meet her its hard to tell anything. I know you have done the research, but until you look eye to eye…" I let my sentence go unfinished.
 
My father looks at me, his gaze as penetrating as an x-ray. "Which is why," he continues, his words slow and measured, "I have decided to keep her close. Close enough that we can monitor her every move."
 
"Makes sense," I respond. “What did you have in mind?”

I think I see a spark of satisfaction flicker in his eyes, but he doesn't pause for congratulations. "Good, I am glad you agree," he affirms. "So she'll be moving in with you, Luca."
 
My world tilts. I blink, processing the words. "Moving in...with me?" I repeat, needing confirmation that I heard him correctly.
 
"Yes." He nods.
 
"Wait a minute. Moving in with me? That's impossible," I protest. "I have a life. I can't be expected to babysit some rich, spoiled brat. This isn't a damned daycare."
 
My father's  gaze hardens, and his jaw sets in a familiar way, a sure sign he isn't backing down. "This isn't up for debate, Luca."
 
My frustration swells, fueled by the audacity of the situation. "Why not Rico, then?" I snap, my hands flailing in emphasis. "Why not task him with this glorified babysitting role?"
 
There's a pause, a silence that amplifies the refrigerator's humming and the clock's distant ticking. My father’s eyes never waver from mine, a hardness settling within them. "Because he’s Rico. He’s great in a touch space, but he’s hardly the man to make a sophisticated woman feel at ease, is he?”
 
I take a breath. He’s right. Rico is loyal, but he’s never been comfortable with a woman. He can face down a murderous thug but ask him to talk to a pretty woman, and he tongue-tied in second. Plus, his history isn’t great with women, and that’s an understatement. My father is correct. I am sure that if he was locked away with a Russian mafia bitch, he’d drive her insane or bury her in the garden. If my father’s plan is going to work, then we’ll need to build her trust and that’s certainly not a job for Rico.
 
A sigh escapes and I nod. “No, you are right. I’d not wish Rico on her.”
 
My father looks at me. “Plus, Luca, you're the only person I trust."
 
The room feels still, even as my pulse picks up pace. I watch my father, a man of few words and even fewer sentiments, admitting to a reliance that weighs more than any responsibility he's ever assigned me. My mouth goes dry, a whirl of emotions twisting within me: resentment, frustration, confusion, and a hint of pride. I swallow hard, meeting his gaze with a determination that mirrors mine.
 
"Alright," I relent, my voice hoarse but resolute. "She can move in."

"So, it's decided. You'll inform her at the meeting tomorrow," he states. 

"Me?"

My father smiles. "You want her to see me doing your dirty work for you?"

"No," I say. I hate that's he is right. 

There's no room for argument, no space for negotiation. I nod in reluctant acceptance; my words swallowed up by the bitterness of the situation.
 
With a final lingering glance, my father strides towards the front door, leaving me alone with my turmoil. The door closes with a decisive click, marking the end of the discussion.
 
The house settles into silence, amplifying the whirlwind of thoughts within my head. I can't help but resent this assignment I've been saddled with. I crave power, influence, and control, yet here I am, reduced to a chaperone for a trust-fund heiress. The irony is bitter and biting. For as long as I can remember, my life has been a constant battle for approval, a relentless pursuit of impressing my father. I often felt he preferred Rico. He’s a man he can relate to, simple pleasures and understandable actions. It's a feeling that's clung to me since childhood, that insatiable hunger for recognition, for validation. And despite all I've achieved, it never seems enough. I am always the dutiful son, the loyal lieutenant, but never the leader I yearn to be.

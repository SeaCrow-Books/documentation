I take her hand and we slip onto the dance floor.
 
Her hand is soft and warm in mine, a stark contrast to the cool, aloof exterior she often displays. The way she glides into my arms is unexpected, like she has always belonged there. The rhythm of the music threads through us, leading our movements as we sway in unison. I can feel her following my steps, her body soft and pliant against mine.
 
Under the chandeliers and soft lights, Bella is dazzling. The black dress clings to her, accentuating every curve and edge of her body. It has a plunging neckline that offers a tempting view of her cleavage, and the fabric flows down to her feet, rippling with every step she takes. I lead, she follows, and for a moment, it feels as if we're the only ones in the room.
 
My eyes are drawn to her lips. They're painted a dark red, a provocative contrast against her pale skin. Her eyes are filled with a mix of emotions - excitement, nervousness, anticipation - and it mirrors my turmoil.
 
I find myself drawn to her. Her scent fills my nostrils - a mixture of her perfume and something uniquely Bella. It's intoxicating, addictive, and it fuels my desire for her. She leans into me, her body fitting perfectly against mine, and it takes everything I have to keep myself from pulling her closer, from closing the distance between us.
 
I find myself wishing that this moment could last forever.
 
I am overcome with a desire to make love to this woman, to take her in my arms and consume her. I want to peel away her clothes and explore her perfect body.
 
I take her hand and pull her towards the entrance. She resists. Her eyes meet mine. There’s an unspoken passion. She hesitates. I pull again and this time, she comes, allowing me to lead her to wherever I want. Each step we take through the manor sends the sounds of the party dissipating into a low murmur, as though we're retreating into our world.
 
We step outside and the cool night air wraps around us. The driverless limo waits at the entrance. Jim is sat with a group of other drivers. A small table has been set up and they are playing cards. He sees us emerge and scrambles into action, grabbing his hat and run-walking to the car. I open the door for her, our hands briefly touching.
 
The car springs into life. “Home,” I say, tapping the button that darkens the windows between us and the drive.
 
Bella's gaze is locked onto mine, and the connection is so intense, I can't help but feel consumed by it. Her eyes speak volumes, revealing a passion that mirrors my own. I lean in, my hand cupping her face. The moment seems suspended in time as I bridge the distance between us. My lips meet hers in a soft, tender kiss. This time she isn’t pulling away. The sensation is overpowering, a potent mix of anticipation, desire, and a longing I've been trying to keep at bay. The kiss deepens, and I can feel the curve of her lips moving in sync with mine, responding to my touch with equal fervor.
 
My other hand slides around her waist, pulling her close, the feel of her body against mine stirring a deep desire. The gentle strength of her hands gripping my shoulders is almost my undoing. Bella is in my arms, her taste lingering on my lips, and it feels more intoxicating than any drink or thrill I've ever experienced. I can't help but wonder what it would be like to explore these uncharted depths, to truly let go and surrender to the passion that threatens to consume us both.
 
The limo pulls away from the manor, the quiet night swallowing the sounds of the party. Yet, the silence within the car is filled with our heavy breaths and the undeniable rhythm of two hearts beating in sync.
 
As our lips remain entwined, my hand finds its way to the swell of her breast beneath the silky material of her dress. My fingertips brush against her nipple, eliciting a sharp intake of breath. The sensation sends a jolt of desire through me. Seizing on her reaction, my grasp becomes firmer, squeezing and caressing, igniting a passion that feels dangerously close to combusting. I grope and grasp at her little tit. Her body moves under my touch. The fact that she wants me as much as I want her is clear and intoxicating.
 
I break away from our kiss, momentarily caught in the depths of her eyes, the heat of her desire matching my own.
 
"Open your legs," I say. She hesitates for a moment, her eyes looking into mine. “Now.”
 
She leans back, parting her knees. Her dress rides up, revealing her black underwear. The sight sends a bolt of pure lust through me, and I'm overwhelmed by the need to please her as much as she wants me to. My cock is rock hard. I am sure it will burst the zip of my trousers.
 
Shifting my weight, I let my hand fall onto her bare thigh, my touch firm against her skin. Her response is immediate, a soft gasp escaping her lips as a visible shiver runs through her body. My hand explores further down, brushing the delicate material of her knickers, causing another gasp. A sly smile pulls at my lips as I sense her anticipation building.
 
"Wider," I say, my voice low and heavy with desire.
 
She obliges, her legs opening even wider.
 
I let my fingers play over her knickers, feeling the hotness through the material. I push a little harder, letting my finger trace her clit. I drop a little lower, pushing against her lips, feeling the wetness. I gaze down at her. I see her legs open, her dress around her waist, the soft pink skin of her legs softened by the light of the limo. My cock twitches. 

She is there, exposed, waiting for me. I look at her and smile.
 
“OK?” I say. She nods.
 
I pull the material of her knickers to one side and let my finger brush the soft skin of her pussy lips. She gasps and I smile. I trace the lips with the tip of my finger, spreading the wetness of her juices. I allow my middle finger to find her clit and move my finger in slow, circular motions. I see her body tense and her breathing quickens. I increase the pressure, moving faster. Her eyes close and she starts to pant. I focus on a steady movement. She is soaking now and I allow my fingers to slip between her lips, coating them in her juices.
 
I focus back on her clit, fast and steady, slow circular movements mixed with harder fast thrusts.
 
She tense. “Oh my God,” she says.
 
I lean closer. My lips almost touching her ear. “Cum for me,” I say.
 
Her body tenses, and I feel a little tremor as pleasure floods her body. I slow my movements and allow the orgasm to run its course.
 
Her eyes open. “Wow,” she says. I smile and kiss her.
 
I adjust her dress, the delicate fabric barely covering the signs of our shared pleasure. As she looks up at me, her eyes still heavy with desire, I lean in for a kiss. 
 
"I am going to fuck you," I say, my voice low and husky. "But not here, not now. 
Later at home. I am going to cum inside you."
 
She nods.
 
As we wind through the city streets, my heart matches the city's rhythm, accelerating with the rising anticipation. The sight of my townhouse growing closer with each passing second is both familiar and oddly exciting. The stately facade, bathed in the soft glow of streetlights, appears more inviting than ever.
 
The limo glides to a smooth halt in front of the entrance. I step out, feeling the cool night air against my skin. Turning back to the car, I extend my hand to help her out. Her fingers tremble slightly in mine. She manages to stand, but her legs betray a small tremble, hinting at the potent mix of exhaustion and desire coursing through her. Before she can fully regain her balance, I scoop her up into my arms, cradling her against my chest. Her eyes widen in surprise and then soften, a quiet trust reflected in their depths. The warmth of her body seeps through the thin fabric of our clothes, stirring the embers of desire that smolder within me.
 
We traverse the staircase leading to the upper levels of the house. The journey feels like a surreal dance, our movements in harmony with the soft murmur of the city night resonating through the open windows. The rich, polished wood under my shoes, the faint rustling of her dress against my arms, the rhythmic echo of our steps reverberating through the house, all add to the symphony of anticipation that fills the air. Her body molds against mine, the contours of her feminine curves harmonizing with my masculine frame. Each breath she takes, each flutter of her lashes, each tiny shift against me, fans the flames of my anticipation.
 
Once inside the bedroom, the outside world begins to feel like a distant memory. The room is bathed in a soft, warm glow. The king-size bed seems more inviting than ever, the luxurious sheets whispering promises of the pleasures yet to come.
 
She stands in front of me, her chest rising and falling with each breath, the anticipation evident in her eyes. I reach out and remove her dress, the fabric slipping away to reveal her semi-nude body underneath. Her body, clad only in a matching set of black lace lingerie, is an intoxicating sight. The delicate material clings to her skin, highlighting her figure's soft curves and valleys. The sight of her silhouette, half-cloaked in shadows is enough to take my breath away.
 
My eyes wander over her, savoring the sight of her bare skin glowing in the candlelight. The gentle swell of her breasts strain against the delicate lace of her bra. The soft valley between them leads my gaze downward, tracing the narrow dip of her waist that flares out to her well-rounded hips. The thin lace band of her knickers accentuates the enticing V-shape of her lower abdomen, the tantalizing hint of her intimacy barely concealed by the delicate fabric. As she reclines onto the bed, her body stretches out against the crisp, white sheets. The contrast between the unblemished linen and her creamy skin is a sight to behold. Her body finds a natural, enticing pose, her back slightly arched, a leg bent at the knee, a smile playing on her lips.
 
I feel the desire rising in me. My cock aches to be inside her.
 
The air seems to grow heavy with longing. The room resonates with an electric tension. Each breath she takes, each tiny movement she makes, feels incredibly intimate. The sight of her inviting me in is almost too much. I need to take her, to consume her, to claim her. Pulling my boxers down, I let my large, erect cock spring free. Her small gasp at the sight of it sends a jolt of pure desire shooting through me. It's clear from her reaction that she's impressed. I smile.
 
Moving between her spread legs, I position myself at her pussy. The tip of my cock is wet with pre-cum, almost touching her. I look down at the sight of her spread legs, with the soft flaps glistening with wetness. She is shaved smooth, her pink skin unblemished.
 
I hold myself back for a moment. I can hear her shallow breaths.
 
I push inside her. I am slow, letting the tip push between her lips. The head of my cock is consumed. I push deeper. The feel of her tight, wet pussy engulfing me is indescribable.
 
"Fuck," I groan, my body reacting to the intense pleasure of being inside her.
 
Feeling her hands clutch at my arms, I reach down grab her wrists and push her arms upwards, pinning them above her head. There’s a hint of struggle and fear in her eyes. I smile down at her. 
 
I thrust my hips against hers in a rhythm that builds. I have been waiting for this moment for so long. I have pictured hundreds of times how I would kiss her body, tasting her skin, allowing her nipples to tease my tongue, taste her pussy, but now, as the moment arrives, primal passion overwhelms me. 

I need her. 

I need to make her mine. 

I need to fill her with my seed.
 
I start to thrust faster, the control gone. Each thrust sends waves of pleasure through us, our bodies moving in perfect sync. I pound into her; each thrust slamming my cock deeper inside her. Her gasps, her moans, the way her body clenches around me – it all pushes me closer and closer to the edge.
 
"Yes," I groan, "that's it. Take my cock."
 
She lets out a small breath. It squeezes between her teeth, something about its involuntary nature is mind-blowing.
 
I cum.
 
I spurt into her, my cock pumping.
 
I close my eyes. I can feel my hot cum squirting deep inside her. I open my eyes and look down. I realize I am still holding her hands above her head. I release my grip on her wrists, collapsing on top of her, my cock still buried deep inside her as the waves of pleasure crash over me.
 
I pull out of her.
 
"You are mine now," I say. “You belong to me.”

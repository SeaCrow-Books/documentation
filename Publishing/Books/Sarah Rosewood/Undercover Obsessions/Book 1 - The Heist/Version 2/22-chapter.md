# Chapter 22
## Luca
 
We drive in silence, the engine's hum the only disruption in our quiet cocoon. Bella sits, her face a mask, the soft contours of her features accentuated by the fading afternoon light. She's staring out the window, seemingly lost in the cityscape speeding past. I feel a subtle tinge of unease. Bella is difficult to decipher, a complex puzzle with pieces that don't always fit the way you'd expect. Her mood shifts like tides â€“ one moment playful and warm, the next distant and pensive.

My mind strays towards the job. I've always worked alone or with Rico, always trusted only myself. But now, there's Bella. Can I trust her? Can I risk everything for her? Rico's words echo in my mind: his doubts about Bella, his concerns about her involvement in our plans. I know he only has my best interests at heart. But he doesn't know Bella like I do. 

Or do I even truly know her?
 
A sudden thought freezes me to my core - if it came down to it, if Rico was right, if Bella betrayed me, could I put a bullet in her? 

The question reverberates in the silence of the car, the implications of it making my heart pound in my chest. I find myself recoiling at the thought. The idea of hurting Bella is repulsive to me, the exact antithesis of the protective instinct that wells up within me whenever I'm around her. Yet the harsh reality of my world, the dark underbelly of my profession, forces me to confront such horrific possibilities.
 
My grip tightens on the steering wheel, the cold reality sinking into me. 
 
My thoughts drift towards my father. Part of me yearns to take control, to be the one pulling the strings, to follow Bianca's lead, but another part of me craves something far removed from this life of deception and danger. 

Something mundane, something...normal. 

Bella has awakened this feeling in me.

My mind paints a picture of an alternate reality in the warm hues of a sunset. A small stone house nestled amidst the sprawling French vineyards. There, I'd take on the life of a simple artist, my days spent translating serene landscapes onto canvas. Bella is with me. There would be children, their laughter filling our home with joy and love. I look at Bella, her quiet beauty accentuated by the flickering city lights. She's the wildcard in my deck, the one element I hadn't considered. And as the impossible dream of a simple, normal life lingers in my mind, I can't help but wonder - could she be the key to a future I've scarcely allowed myself to contemplate?
 
A wave of despair crashes over me. The streetlights outside cast long shadows inside the car. My grip tightens on the steering wheel, the cold, hard reality sinking in - I am trapped.
 
There's a prison that one builds around themselves, crafted not from iron bars but from decisions and deeds of the past. A feeling of suffocation grips me. It's the realization of a life designed from which escape seems impossible. I am a criminal. That is my reality, my curse. My life is one of constantly looking over my shoulder, always ready for the next fight, forever stuck in this relentless cycle. The dream of a simple life in southern France is a cruel joke. The tranquility of that life and the normality I crave seem unreachable. A bitter laugh escapes my lips, the sound harsh in the otherwise silent car.
 
This is my life - I am a fool to wish for more.

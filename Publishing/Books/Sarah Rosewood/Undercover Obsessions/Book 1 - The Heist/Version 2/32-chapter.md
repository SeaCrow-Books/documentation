# Chapter 32
## Luca
 
Stepping out of the car, I take a deep breath, the frigid night air slicing through me. With my eyes locked on the warehouse entrance, I advance, firearm poised and ready. As I arrive at the door, I halt, straining my ears for any sounds emanating from within. Hearing nothing, I steady my hold on the gun and nudge the door open, stepping inside.
 
It takes a moment for my eyes to adapt to the poorly lit environment. Sparse, feeble overhead lights cast a ghostly luminescence on the frosty concrete floor. Towering shelves bearing layers of dust-coated boxes and forsaken tools line the walls. Deserted, rusted machinery stands as silent witnesses to the relentless march of time. The air is dense with the aroma of oil, dampness, and decay. 

Bella stands close to the entrance, her hands uplifted in a gesture of surrender. The tension gripping her body is tangible as she remains immobilized. The bag with the invaluable artwork lies at her feet.
 
My focus shifts across the room. 

I am expecting to see Rico, hands outstretched, gun ready to fire but it is Bianca that comes into view. Cloaked in a sleek black ensemble, she appears to dissolve into the darkness. Her hair is yanked back into a no-nonsense ponytail, outlining a face void of emotion. Her frosty, strategic eyes are fixed on Bella. A small silver hand gun is clenched in her hand, pointing directly at Bella.
 
Bianca's lips contort into a wicked grin, and she swivels her icy gaze my way. "Ah, Luca," she says in a seductive purr. "Your presence here doesn't surprise me. I had a hunch you two were an item. I knew this little bitch couldn’t keep a secret." Her eyes dart back to Bella, who mirrors my bafflement.
 
“Bianca,” I say. “Put the gun down, we can talk about this. There’s still a chance we can all just walk away from this.”
 
Bianca looks at me and back at Bella. She stands for a moment, her face blank, her eyes calculating. She smiles. "So, has lover boy told you about us yet?" Bianca asks.
 
Bella's eyes expand, her bewilderment deepening as she digests Bianca's insinuations. 
 
"What is she talking about, Luca?" Bella demands, her voice barely audible.
 
Bianca erupts into laughter. "Oh, he didn’t spill the beans, did he?" She scoffs. "Luca and I have been intimate for quite some time. He has been happily fucking his father’s wife for years. Isn't that so, lover?" 

My heart tightens with remorse and humiliation as I remain standing, incapable of denying the blatant truth. I stutter, groping for the right words. "It's not what you're thinking, Bella," I say, but my plea lacks credibility. It is what she thinks. Its dirty and sordid. 
 
Bella's gaze hardens as she scrutinizes me, a cocktail of fury and heartache brewing in her expression. "It seems blatantly obvious to me, Luca," she retorts, her tone icy and unrelenting.
 
Bianca chortles. "Awww, are you lovebirds having a tiff?" She mocks, swinging her firearm between us. "How adorable. Seems that she’s not happy with sloppy seconds.” She laughs. “Did he do that thing where he gets all dominant and takes off his belt? I am sure he practices that in the mirror.” She looks to Bella and back at me. “Tutt, tutt Luca, your games are getting old. You need some new tricks.”
 
“Shut the fuck up,” I say. 
 
Bianca shrugs. “But let's not stray from the matter at hand, shall we?"
 
"Why are we here, Bianca? Why are you after the painting?" I ask.
 
Bianca's smirk returns, her eyes reflecting calculated cruelty. "Why? Why do you think Luca? You know me as well as anyone. Why would I do this?”
 
I take a breath. “Money.” I pause. “Or power. Both probably. You have some kind of scheme worked out.”
 
She smiles. “Pretty good.” She looks over at Bella. “We have history, you know.” She allows the word history to hold in the air. “Close Luca. It's mostly because of that bloated, decrepit man you address as your father. You know, I've always been about the money, Luca. I endured him and his pitiful lifestyle solely for the financial benefits. From the first time I saw him I knew I would be able to milk him dry. But it came with a price, having to live with him daily, putting up with his sweating body and tiny prick. Pretending I gave a shit. The problem with pretending is that, at some point, you have to stop and be true to yourself. And now, with this artwork, I can bid it all goodbye and live happily ever after.”
 
My fists tighten as anger washes over me. "You'll never get away with it."

Bianca smiles. "What makes you think that?" She laughs. 

I look across to Bella. Her hands have slipped to her side and she is starting at Bianca. 

"A bit of a conundrum, don't you think, lover boy," Bianca says, her eyes fixed on me. "So…,” she shifts her weight, her body facing me but her gun still trained on Bella, “let's not forget about her." She gestures with her gun towards Bella. "This little tattle tale. Tell me, Luca, what's it like sleeping with a cop? Does you cock smell of bacon in the morning?"
 
Bella glares at Bianca, a mix of rage and disbelief clouding her expression. "How did you figure out I'm a cop?"
 
Bianca grins. "I didn't. Not until you confirmed it just now. I had my suspicions when I came across the burner phone. It had only one number stored, which struck me as odd. I dialed the number, and it connected me to some Russian joint. I knew then you were up to something. You were either a cop or a Russian mafia mole double-crossing Vittorio. But to be honest, I don't care if you're law enforcement or a corrupt mobster. It's all the same to me; I'm just after the painting."
 
Bella meets my gaze, determination set in her expression. "She's getting the painting," she proclaims.
 
Bianca's smirk reappears. "Good girl. She’s a good girl, right Luca?"
 
"No," I contest, my grip tightening on my weapon.
 
My eyes dart between Bella and Bianca as the gun swings in my direction.
 
"So, Luca, what's it going to be? What’s your play? Here, I'll simplify it for you. What's to stop me from shooting you, then her, and just taking the painting?"
 
I attempt a casual shrug. "What's to prevent me from shooting you and claiming the painting for myself?"
 
Bianca's eyes widen in disbelief. "Really?" she challenges. "Would you dare betray your father? He'd have your head. You'd be on the run for the rest of your life. You'd gamble all that for a bitch like her? Besides, she's a cop and she'd bear witness to murder. She’s going to shop you the first moment she gets; if she doesn’t, if you come up with some little happy ever after, it's just a matter of time. That guilt will gnaw at her; she’ll wake every morning next to a thief and murderer, knowing that just one phone call and she can go back to her normal life. She is a cop, face it no judge will convict her. She’ll spin a story of how you controlled her and they will lock you up and throw away the key. It was just a matter of time. Eventually, she'd have to disclose everything. Let's face it, Luca, you are fucked. You can shoot me but you'll have to kill her, too. Perhaps not today, but someday."
 
She's mistaken. Bella would never turn on me.
 
Would she?
 
I hold Bianca's stare, my thoughts spinning with visions of life on the run with Bella.
 
The painting is worth a fortune, priceless. I have the contacts to sell it; I’d not get the real value, but enough to escape. We could leave the country, assume new identities, and carve out a fresh existence. I see a humble home in an obscure French village in Loire Valley, where our pasts and secrets are unknown. Days full of simple chores and peaceful moments, cultivating our own food, engaging in long walks together, constructing a serene life far from the turmoil we've left behind. I would paint and there could be children.
 
Of course, we'd face hurdles, forever glancing over our shoulders, questioning when our past might finally catch up. But we'd confront them as a team, shoulder to shoulder.
 
Yet, a trace of uncertainty nags at me.
 
Can I genuinely discard everything I've known – my father, the gang, the life I've lived until now – all for a woman? Given our tainted histories, is it even feasible to envision a life together?
 
And is Bianca right? Would Bella eventually betray me?
 
I glance at Bella, her eyes reflecting a blend of terror and resolve, and my heart surges with a potent sense of guardianship. In that instant, I realize I'm prepared to gamble everything for her, to struggle for a shot at a life together, no matter how perilous or unpredictable that future might be.
 
Taking a deep breath, I reach my decision.
 
"Yes," I say, "I'd risk everything for her."
 
Bianca cackles, leveling her gun at Bella. "Change of plans," she announces. "I shoot her, and you run away with me. We offload the painting, divide the cash, and part ways. What do you say?"
 
My mind whirls with the implications of her new proposition.
 
I attempt to fathom leaving Bella behind, a lifeless, bleeding body, all for the sake of the painting and the wealth it could generate. I visualize fleeing with Bianca, the guilt of Bella's death a crushing burden. We'd sell the painting, walk away with a substantial fortune, and I'd be left alone, dealing with the fragments of my broken life. Could I live with myself if I choose this path? What kind of man would that make me?
 
I picture a life without Bella, one where I return to the criminal underworld, numb and hardened from my decision to sacrifice the woman I love. Money would be plentiful, but my heart would be empty, haunted by the memory of what I had done.
 
I look at Bianca, my gaze steady. "I'm sorry."
 
My finger tightens on the trigger, and the gun spits to life. The bullet slams into Bianca's chest, shattering her sternum and tearing through her heart. Her eyes widen in shock and pain as a dark crimson stain spreads across her chest, the blood soaking into her clothes. Bianca's body jerks, her arms flailing as she loses control and begins to spin. As she turns, the force of the gunshot propels her off balance, and she stumbles backward. She hits the floor with a strangled gasp, her limbs sprawled out in an unnatural, twisted position.
 
Bella screams and drops to her knees, her hands covering her face. "What have you done?" she cries out, her voice shaking. "What have you done, Luca?"
 
I look at her. "What I had to. I put a bullet in her and saved your life, Bella. Our lives."
 
Bella sobs. “What have you done? What have you done? What have you done?” Her body is wracked with shock and grief. 

I bend down and hoist the bag with the painting over my shoulder. I grab Bella by the wrist, feeling her trembling as I pull her to her feet.
 
"We have to go, Bella," I urge, my voice gentle but insistent. “Now.”

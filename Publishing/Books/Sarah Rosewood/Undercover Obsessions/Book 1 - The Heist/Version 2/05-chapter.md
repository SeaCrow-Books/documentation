# Chapter 5
## Bella
 
The urban sprawl gradually recedes, as the taxi navigates through the city. The taxi veers off the main road onto a lesser-traveled route that threads its way through a secluded industrial area. Warehouses punctuate the landscape, their clean, geometric lines contrasting with the ruggedness of the surrounding environment. The area, though isolated, is far from desolate. A handful of vehicles dot the parking lots and the hum of distant machinery is faint but persistent, like a pulse beneath the skin of this industrial heartland.
 
The taxi pulls up to a large, modern warehouse. The edifice stands resolute, its façade a tapestry of steel and glass that reflects the subdued hues of the overcast sky. The large roller shutter door is closed, but a smaller door stands slightly ajar.
 
I pay the taxi driver and watch as it taxi retreats, its departure echoing in the space, leaving me alone in front of the imposing warehouse. I draw a deep breath. As I stare at the door, the mundane portal that is about to transform my life, I can almost taste the tang of adrenaline. With one last sweeping look at the world I'm leaving behind, I grip the cold metal handle of the door. I let the chill seep into my skin, grounding me and reminding me of the gravity of this moment. I take a deep, steadying breath, pulling in the cool air until my lungs. 

I open the door and step through letting it close behind me with a soft click. It’s a small sound, but to me, it's deafening. The warehouse looms around me, bathed in overhead fluorescent sharp, clinical light. Shelving unit rows stretch towards the roof, their metal frames sturdy and immovable. Each shelf cradles a multitude of brown boxes, uniformly nondescript and intentionally uninteresting. There's a uniformity here, a system of organized chaos that speaks volumes about the operation it supports. Off to one side, a sleek forklift stands sentinel. Despite the beast of a machine's rugged purpose, it's immaculate - a stark piece of modern machinery amidst the rustic simplicity of the warehouse.
 
The focal point of this vast space isn't the imposing shelving or the silent forklift; it's the out-of-place assembly right at the center. An imposing trestle table sits amidst the industrial surroundings, its well-polished surface gleaming under the unyielding light. The table hosts an eclectic group. Four figures are seated around it, each absorbed in their thoughts, their anticipation practically radiating off them. There's an empty chair. Beside the table, a large whiteboard stands. Sheets of paper are tacked onto it haphazardly, their edges fluttering with each artificial breeze from the ventilation system.
 
The man at the head of the table turns to face me, and I'm momentarily taken aback. There's a gravitational pull to him, an unspoken command that radiates off his larger-than-life persona. I recognize him from his picture Harrison gave me. This is Vittorio, the patriarch of the Vella family. He is a study in contradictions. Middle-aged and overweight, he bears the scars of time. His hair, thinning at the top, is carefully styled in a futile attempt to conceal the encroaching baldness. Though bloated and weary from years of indulgence, his face retains traces of a handsome youth long past. Despite the physical toll of his lifestyle, he projects an aura of power and wealth. His tailored suit is of high quality, and the silk tie and polished leather shoes complement his look.
 
The air shifts as he meets my gaze, his eyes shrewd and calculating. "Ahh," he says, standing, the corner of his mouth lifting in a half-smile that doesn't reach his eyes. "The mysterious Miss Gordievsky." His voice reverberates around the warehouse. “Come join us.”
 
Moving with measured steps, I approach the table. The two men sitting on either side of the table rise to their feet. The one to the left, a man of intimidating stature and hardened features, wears a black t-shirt that emphasizes his muscular build. His steely eyes observe me. This must be Rico, the muscle of the Vella family. The other, to the right, is younger, sporting a tailored suit that fits him like a glove. His sharp, handsome features are a stark contrast to Rico's ruggedness. I instinctively know that this is Luca.
 
Contrary to the men, the woman sitting beside Luca remains seated. She is chic and poised, her cold gaze raking over me as if assessing my worth. Her icy blonde hair cascades around her shoulders, providing a striking contrast against her black dress. This must be Bianca, Vittorio’s much younger wife.
 
I take the vacant chair, my gaze meeting each of theirs in turn.
 
Vittorio's gaze lands on me, assessing, evaluating. "So, Miss Gordievsky," he starts, his voice rough, like gravel underfoot. "Do you know why you're here?"
 
"Please, call me Bella, and of course," I respond, meeting his gaze head-on. "We're here to steal a Van Gogh; my role is to provide the necessary technical support."
 
A flash of satisfaction crosses Vittorio's weathered face, his lips curving up into a smug smile. "Good. I see you're up to speed," he says, leaning back in his chair.
 
I lean forward, resting my elbows on the table, my expression serious. "It's not my first rodeo," I say, an air of forced confidence surrounding my words. "I am a professional, I hope I can say the same for you." He smiles. There is a moment of silence. "Please call be Bella," I say and he nods. "The painting resurfaced after disappearing for years. Our job is to break into this country house, grab it, and run. Simple as that. I will ensure the doors are open and the alarms are off. I am ready to do my job; I hope you lot are equally prepared. I don’t work with amateurs."
 
Vittorio chuckles. His eyes, previously hard, soften slightly, a quiet mirth in them. "I admire your confidence," he says, a thin smirk adorning his lips. "But I assure you, it's a tad more complex than that." He looks at Luca. “Fill us in."
 
"I know you have all heard this before, so this is for Bella's ears mostly. Here's the rundown," Luca says. His voice is calm and confident, carrying a certain authoritative timbre that commands attention. His gaze alternates between the group and the whiteboard covered in scribbles and pinned notes. "Bella and I will be the ones on the ground. We'll park the car in a secluded lane close to the target location, hidden in the darkness." He moves a hand over a part of the plan sketched on the whiteboard. "From there, we scale a small fence surrounding the estate and make our way to the rear entrance. We'll be practically invisible. The back door is secured with a digital lock. Bella here," Luca gestures towards me, "is in charge of dealing with the lock. I am promised she can bypass this and the alarms; otherwise, I am not sure why she’s even here."
 
As Luca speaks, I take the opportunity to study him. He's a compelling figure, radiating confidence and authority. His features are hard and his body is clearly well-maintained. He moves with a fluid grace that speaks of a readiness to respond to any situation. The control he exudes is both powerful and somehow magnetic. His dark eyes are sharp, assessing everything around him with a strategic gaze. His voice is steady and certain, filling the room as he breaks down our plan. He speaks with the conviction of someone who has been in this game long enough to easily navigate its twists and turns. However, he lacks a certain softness that I find attractive in men - the quiet, thoughtful sensitivity that comes with deep introspection. He's more of a doer, a man of action, not one for lengthy philosophical discussions or analyzing the human condition. His confidence, while attractive, is a stark contrast to the nuanced empathy I find endearing in a partner.
 
"From there," Luca says and points at the map, "we navigate through the estate, making our way to the main ballroom. That's where the Van Gogh is." He pauses, letting the information sink in. "It will be alarmed. Again, Bella will do her bit and kill the alarm. We take the painting, slip out the way we came in, get back to the car, and we're off."
 
Luca ends his explanation with a casual shrug, as though it's a routine Sunday drive, not a meticulously planned art heist. 
 
Vittorio's gaze shifts to Rico, his eyebrows arching in silent inquiry. Rico straightens up in his chair, his face becoming serious. "Backup," he states. He looks at me and I hold his gaze though I want to look away from his shark-like eyes. "If you see me, something's gone to shit." His voice is gravelly, as though the very thought of our plan going awry grates on him. "I'll be tucked away close by, on the other end of a walkie-talkie. I'm the failsafe." Rico flexes his large hands, the veiny topography speaking of a history dotted with clenched fists and the grip of weaponry. "I'll be packing some hardware." He grimaces. "So, if the shit hits the fan, it'll be my job to make sure you two make it out alive and in one piece."
 
His words hang in the air, vividly depicting a worst-case scenario. They're an uncomfortable reminder of what we're risking but also a reassurance. If things go wrong, Rico's there, ready to step in and pull us out of the fire.
 
I look at the only other woman in the room - Bianca. She meets my gaze with a knowing smile. "I see you looking missy. I'm the brains and the beauty," she announces, a hint of playful arrogance tinging her voice. The men around the table erupt into laughter, their deep chuckles echoing in the cavernous warehouse. I smile, not in on the joke.
 
Vittorio sobers up, his smile fading as he turns to me. "Bianca is the glue that holds our family together," he explains, his tone laced with deep respect. "She won't be involved directly in the operation, but she'll be working behind the scenes."
 
'Behind the scenes'. The phrase lingers in the air. Even without the particulars, I understand what that means. In this line of work, the magic often happens away from the main stage. I make a mental note to pay close attention to her. I have a strange feeling she is more important than is being let on.
 
"Luca and Bella," Vittorio starts, his eyes shifting back and forth between the two of us. "You'll work out the details together over the next few days."
 
The silence that follows his declaration is deafening. Everyone seems lost in their thoughts, grappling with the realities of the task. The warehouse, usually buzzing with activity, feels eerily quiet, the usual sounds absorbed by the towering stacks of cardboard boxes.
 
Vittorio breaks the silence, his gaze scanning the faces at the table. "Any questions?" he asks, the authority in his voice undisputed.
 
Rico grunts, pulling everyone's attention towards him.

"Spit it out," Vittorio says looking at Rico.
 
Rico leans back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. "It's her," he says, jerking his head in my direction. "I don't trust her. We know nothing about her. For all we know, she could be a cop."
 
“She’s not a cop,” Vittorio says, holding Rico’s gaze.
 
Rico shrugs. “Could be. Plus, well… fuck, come on, Vittirio, this isn’t woman’s work; men’s lives are at risk here. I don’t want to get shot because some Barbie fucked up.”
 
Bianca laughs. “Fuck off Rico, you chauvinist pig. Since when has being a woman had anything to do with anything? She is tapping buttons on a laptop but digging a fucking mine.” She turns to Vittorio. “Come on, love, tell this fucking neanderthal to shut his mouth.”
 
Vittorio sighs. He looks at Bianco. “Rico has the right to ask any questions he wants.” He turns to Rico. “But Rico, she’s right; what’s it matter if she’s a woman?” Rico shrugs and averts his gaze from Vittiro. “Anything else you want to get off your chest?”
 
There’s a moment of silence. I look over to Rico. He makes eye contact with me. He holds it. I know that I shouldn’t look away like you shouldn’t break eye contact with an angry dog, but there’s something about how he looks at me that means I have to break contact.
 
“Yeah, Rico,” says, “I have another question.”
 
Vittoiro sighs. “Go on.”
 
Rico looks at me. “So your dad is Russian and he’s connected. Right?”
 
“Yes,” I say, “very connected.” I emphasize the word ‘connected’.
 
“Your mother?” Rico’s eyes remain on me.
 
“A Russian ballet dancer. A cliché I know, Russian mob boss marries pretty dancer, but they are cliches for a reason.”
 
“So, let me get this right. Russian dad, Russian mum, right?”
 
“Yes. You catch on quick and here’s me thinking Luca was the brains of the operation.” I hear Bianca chuckle. 
 
“So why no Russian accent? What accent do you have there, Central London?”
 
I smile. Rico is good. He’s more observant than I had first thought. I make a mental note not to underestimate him. “I was born in the UK. St Mary's Hospital. My dad fled the motherland just after Gorbachev came to power. We came to the UK; the British Government at the time was keen to see Russian money invested in the capital, and they were happy not to ask questions. When the regime changed, he went back to Russia. It was felt that I was safer in England since I was technically a UK citizen.” I let the silence hold for a moment. “I have never been to Russia.”
 
Rico holds my gaze. “So a fake Russian princess then?”
 
I smile. “Better that than a wannbe wiseguy.”
 
Luca laughes and Rico looks away. I let the silence fall again.
 
“Ohh, Rico, you were nearly right though,” I say.
 
“About what? Rico asks.
 
“The accent. Hampstead.”
 
Luca laughs again, louder this time.
 
“Fuck off,” Rico says, anger washing over his face.
 
Vittorio raises a hand to silence him. "OK children. This is all great and if you have no more questions, I’d like to get on. For the record, and this is aimed mainly at our friend Rico, Bella here has been vetted by me personally. I have complete trust in her." He turns his gaze to Rico, a silent challenge in his eyes. "Which means... so do you understand?"
 
Rico lets out a huge sigh, shrugging his broad shoulders. "If you say so, boss. But I'll be keeping an eye on her."
 
Vittorio's gaze, stern and unwavering, shifts to me. "So will I." His voice is a low rumble, filled with an implicit warning. He arches an eyebrow at me, a challenge in his eyes. "That okay with you?"
 
Feeling a flutter of panic, I gather my composure. I steady my gaze, meeting Vittorio's eyes. "Of course," I answer, keeping my voice steady and firm. "I'd be suspicious in your situation, too." I try to keep my tone casual, nonchalant, even though my heart is racing in my chest. 
 
Vittorio seems satisfied with my response, his gaze softening a touch. He stands from the table, smoothing down his tailored suit jacket as he does so. "Alright, that's it for now," he declares, his voice echoing in the cavernous space. His eyes flicker to Luca. "Stay back a minute, I want a word." He turns to me. "You too, Bella."
 
Nods and murmurs of assent echo around the table. Bianca stands, casting me a curious look before she strides off, the clicking of her heels echoing in the warehouse. Rico grunts, his suspicious gaze lingering on me a moment longer before he follows suit, disappearing behind a stack of boxes.
 
Vittorio gestures for Luca to follow him. They move a little distance away, deep in conversation, their words too low for me to catch. I stand watching, unsure if they expect me to follow or stay. The discussion ends and Vittorio turns and leaves without looking at me.
 
I can't help but be impressed as Luca strides toward me, a picture of power and control. He's taller than I had pictured, his presence filling the warehouse, even in its enormity. His posture exudes an air of dominance, yet undeniable tension is lining his features.
 
"Father wants me to keep an eye on you," he says, looming over me. His voice is steady, certain. The weight of his gaze is almost physical, like a hand pressing down on my shoulders.
 
A surge of indignation sparks within me. "I don't need a babysitter," I snap, more defensive than I'd like. “Is this because of what Rico said?”
 
Luca sighs, raking a hand through his slicked-back hair, his facade of composure breaking for a moment. "No, this has nothing to do with Rico and I know you don’t need a babysitter. And, for the record, it's not my idea of a good time either." He studies me for a moment, his dark eyes thoughtful. "But this is a tough situation, Bella. And if we're going to pull this off, we need to do things my father's way. That's something you should learn quickly."
 
I try to relax. The tension from the conversation with Rico still fills my body. I can’t help but think Rico’s questions were a test and that I did the right thing to meet fire with fire. "What do you have in mind?" I ask, folding my arms over my chest. I'm not sure I want to hear the answer.
 
Luca doesn't miss a beat. "You're moving in with me."
 
The words hang in the air between us. I blink, taken aback by the audacity of his statement. "That's impossible," I retort, my voice rising with disbelief. "I'm staying at a hotel. It is arranged."
 
His expression remains impassive, almost bored. "That was before. This is now. Plans have changed." I open my mouth to argue, but he cuts me off. "Look, Bella," he starts, pinching the bridge of his nose, "this isn't an option. Father will call the job off if you're not prepared to do this. It's as simple as that. He might have pushed Rico back into his box but he has a point. Father only trusts because he has no choice. You being under my watch will smooth the water with everyone."
 
His words are a cold splash of reality. I stare at him, my mind whirring with the implications of what he's saying.
 
I'm thrown off balance. Moving in with Luca...it carries so many risks. Not just in terms of the operation, but for me personally as well. But what choice do I have? If I say no, they could cut me loose and I'd lose the gang. Months of work, of preparation, would be wasted.
I can almost see the strings of my life tangling, twisting in ways I didn't anticipate. This is a test of my ability to adapt and my commitment to the mission. And while a very small, very dangerous part of me even finds a trace of excitement at the idea of living under the same roof as this undeniably attractive man, I quickly quash it. I'm here to do a job, not to get involved in...whatever this is shaping up to be.
 
I nod. "OK, but I am not happy about it."
 
"Nor me, this isn't exactly my idea of a good time either," he mutters, his eyes glinting with annoyance. "A rich daddy's girl cluttering up my space."
 
His words sting and it takes all the self-restraint I've got not to snap back at him. I am shocked that I care what this man thinks about me. I bite back a sarcastic retort, opting to keep things professional. 

"So what now?" I ask, forcing a steady tone.
 
He runs a hand through his hair, looking as if he'd rather be anywhere but here. "I'll drive you back to your hotel. You can pack your things; then we can... get this show on the road."
 
"Just like that?" I ask, feeling as if I'm being swept up in a whirlwind. But, I remind myself, this is what I signed up for.
 
"Just like that," he confirms, giving me a curt nod.

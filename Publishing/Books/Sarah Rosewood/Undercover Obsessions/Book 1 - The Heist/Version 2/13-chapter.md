# Chapter 13
## Bella
 
I am sitting on my bed, my laptop humming in the silence of my room. The screen is alight with a glow that seems to be the only thing offering me any comfort right now. But I can't focus on what's in front of me; my mind's spiraling, lost in a whirlpool of fears and suspicions steadily growing since I discovered the phone missing.
 
Could it have been Luca? 

He's always around and knows my habits. He'd easily have the opportunity to slip into my room while I was away. But wouldn't he have confronted me immediately if he found the phone? The question circles in my mind like a ravenous predator, but I can't find an answer that settles my nerves.
 
Then there's Vittorio. 

He, too, had the chance to search my room, yet he didn't say a word when we stood together in the kitchen. Would he remain silent, though? It doesn't fit his style not to exploit an advantage when he has one. He is impulsive.
 
And what about Rico or Bianca? 

They've both had their opportunities and for all I know, either of them could be waiting for the right moment to spring their trap. Trying to find a time when they have the most to gain. The thought of betrayal from them stings, but I can't ignore the possibility.
 
A knock at my door snaps me out of my spiraling thoughts. "Come in," I call, turning to face the door as it swings open. In walks Luca. My breath catches at the sight of him.
 
Luca is what I can only describe as devastatingly handsome. His jawline is chiseled perfection, setting off his striking blue eyes that never fail to hold a spark of mischief. His hair, a lustrous shade of midnight black, falls in effortless waves over his forehead. It's just begging someone to run their fingers through, and I must resist the urge to do just that. The man is tall, a good head and shoulders over me, and it's clear he takes care of his physique. His suits always hint at the sculpted muscles that lie beneath, a testament to countless hours spent in the gym. His skin, a gorgeous shade of golden tan, glows with vitality and health. He's holding a gift bag in his hand, but it's him that feels like a gift to my senses. The way he looks at me, with concern etching lines in his perfect forehead, sends a shiver down my spine. It's a shiver that speaks of fear, yes, but also... something else. Something that feels dangerously close to desire.
 
"Are you okay?" he asks, pulling me back from my thoughts. “I am err… worried about you. You’ve been quiet and distant.”
 
I nod, managing to keep my voice steady as I answer. "Yes, I'm fine." The lie slips out easier than I thought. “Just a bit apprehensive about the party.”
 
Luca moves to sit on the bed next to me, our thighs nearly touching. The sudden proximity makes my breath hitch, a sense of electricity humming in the air between us. The bed dips under his weight, pulling me slightly towards him. My heart thuds in my chest, making me wonder if he can hear it too.
 
He hands me the gift bag with a small smile. "I bought you a present," he tells me. His voice is low and gentle, stirring something warm in the pit of my stomach.
 
I look at him, taken aback. Why would Luca buy me a gift? We barely know each other, let alone share any significant bond that warrants gift-giving. But as I take in his expectant look, my curiosity takes over.
 
I reach into the bag, the rustling of the tissue paper loud in the quiet room. It's not a big bag, but it's heavy with anticipation. A sense of unease washes over me as I pull out a velvet string bag. I feel the soft texture against my fingers. My hands tremble as I open the bag to reveal a sleek, Stella McCartney clutch. It's a petite, rectangular masterpiece made of smooth black satin, edged with subtle golden hardware. Stella's emblematic logo adorns the front in gold, giving a hint of the luxury that the bag represents. Its design exudes sophistication and elegance, making it the perfect accessory for a high-class ball. A delicate chain strap is tucked inside, offering the versatility to carry it over the shoulder or simply in hand. Despite its compact size, it's perfectly capable of holding all the essentials for an evening out. 
 
My mind races as I try to process this unexpected gesture. "Th... thank you," I manage to stammer out.
 
Luca smiles at me, his eyes shining with a hint of pride. "It's for the ball tomorrow. To match your dress." His voice is calm, as though it's the most natural thing in the world for him to be gifting me with such luxury.
 
I'm caught off guard for a moment, looking at him with wide eyes. I hadn't expected Luca, of all people, to have such an eye for fashion. But then again, nothing about this man is as it seems. The thoughtfulness behind the gift touches a part of me, and for a fleeting second, I see Luca in a different light. There's more to him than just the hardened criminal, and it's this thought that leaves me more unsettled than I care to admit.
 
"There's more," Luca says, his eyes twinkling with an infectious excitement that's hard to ignore. "Look inside the velvet bag."

I reach into the bag and my fingers brush against the cool surface of a case. My heart flutters as I pull it out and flip open the lid. Inside lies a diamond necklace, perfectly crafted and radiating an unparalleled elegance. The diamonds, each flawlessly cut, shimmer with an exquisite brilliance, catching the light and casting a soft glow around me. The chain is simple, yet the overall effect is stunning.
 
"This one is real," Luca announces, the pride in his voice impossible to ignore.
 
"It's... It's too much, Luca," I stutter out, awestruck by the piece of jewelry. The thought of wearing such a priceless piece sends a shiver of nervous excitement down my spine.
 
Luca shakes his head. "We are going undercover, Bella. You need to look the part. And besides, I wanted to treat you. To say thank you for making the best of the situation."
 
His words seem sincere and heartfelt. I find myself lost in a whirlwind of emotions, gratitude being the strongest. It's not the gift but the thought behind it that affects me. And in this moment, my perception of Luca Vella shifts once again. I lean forward to embrace Luca. His arms wrap around me, sturdy and assured, like a cocoon protecting me from the world outside. I find my face nestled in the crook of his neck, the scent of his aftershave - woodsy and subtly spicy - filling my senses. For a moment, everything else fades into the background. We hold onto the hug longer than necessary, as if both of us are unwilling to break the intimate bubble we've unknowingly created. The rhythm of his heartbeat, steady against my chest, offers a comfort that I didn't know I needed.
 
An unexpected revelation dawns on me in that moment. All these years, I've prided myself on my independence, shunning the idea of needing someone, thinking it was a sign of weakness. Yet here I am, wrapped in the arms of a man who was almost a stranger until a few days ago, feeling an odd sense of safety and warmth. The question gnaws at me - have I been wrong all along? Could it be possible that I've been mistaking my guarded heart for strength, not realizing that allowing someone in to care and protect could be a source of power? The confusion and uncertainty sit heavy in my heart as I reluctantly pull away from the hug.
 
I pull back from the hug, and my gaze locks with Luca's. His eyes, a deep cerulean blue, hold an intensity that sends a jolt of electricity through me. Unconsciously, we both lean in, our faces inching closer. I close my eyes, surrendering to the pull I feel towards him. The soft brush of his lips against mine sends a rush of adrenaline coursing through me. But just as swiftly as the desire surges, reality sets in. I jerk back, a sudden panic seizing me.
 
I can't let this happen.
 
"Luca," I stammer. "We... we need to stay professional."

I want Luca, that much is clear. But the risk it brings and the possibility of losing myself in his world scares me. More than any heist, more than any confrontation, the idea of opening up to someone and revealing my vulnerabilities terrifies me. And now, I realize it's a risk I am not ready to take.
 
I watch Luca rise, a soft apology leaving his lips before he steps out of the room. The door closes behind him with a soft click. The room falls into a silence. I let my gaze drop to the exquisite piece of jewelry resting in their velvet-lined boxes on the bed next to me.

I swallow hard, forcing the knot of emotion lodged in my throat to dislodge. There's no room for sentiment in this dangerous game I'm playing. I can't afford to lose sight of my goal, to let my feelings for Luca cloud my judgment.
 
I need to remember who I am, and what I'm here for.

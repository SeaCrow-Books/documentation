# Chapter 21
## Bella
 
Sunlight splashes the world in a riot of blues, the heavens themselves streaked with clouds that wisp their way across the sky. A sea of tranquility engulfs Luca and me as we lose ourselves in the sprawling wonder of the zoo. It is a marvel of natural beauty and human engineering, an oasis tucked within the city's urban heartbeat. The paths we walk are lined with leafy green foliage, the air heavy with the scent of damp earth and the musky aroma of exotic flora. Overhead, the interlaced canopy of trees plays host to an ever-changing dance of shadows and sunlight, dappling everything in a cool, refreshing glow. Around us, life thrives in all its glorious forms. The distant rumble of a lion's roar, the exotic squawk of a bird unseen, and the steady hum of insects all meld into a symphony of nature that invades the senses. Artificial water bodies, their surfaces shimmering under the sunlight, are scattered throughout, their banks attracting all sorts of life, from curious visitors to even more curious animals.
 
The zoo is bustling with visitors. Families weave through the throng, children laughing with unrestrained joy as they scamper from one exhibit to another. Couples stroll hand-in-hand, lost in their world, while groups of friends share excited chatter, their laughter echoing amidst the chorus of animal sounds. Despite the crowd, there's a relaxed atmosphere that pervades the zoo. People often pause, observing the animals or reading about them on the informational plaques. 
 
Our hands are woven together, his larger one engulfing mine in a strong and gentle hold. It's a quiet intimacy that thrills me to the core, the world bearing witness to our connection. There's a stirring of pride in my chest, a keen delight in being at his side. His attractiveness and confidence make us a beacon, drawing a wealth of admiring glances that I bask in.
 
The memory of this morning lingers in my mind, a scorching echo of passion that still sends warmth blooming across my skin. I'd barely stepped into the shower when Luca joined me. His desire was a palpable force, one that stirred mine in response. Our joining was gentle yet fervent, Luca seemingly insatiable, as if every touch, every kiss only stoked his need for more. Upon reaching the zoo, I found a bustling crowd milling about the entrance. But Luca, with his enigmatic air of command, bypassed them all, leading us to a lesser-known door. A brief exchange with the guard and we were in, bypassing the queue entirely. Luca casually admitted that the zoo's director owed him a 'favor'. This left me intrigued, a tantalizing glimpse into his vast network of connections.

We arrive at the elephant exhibit, and the sight takes my breath away. Their size is immense, something you'd imagine to be ponderous, yet they move with delicacy. Their interactions are fascinating, the playful splash of water, the flinging of hay, and the affectionate nudges all tell a story of companionship.
 
"Remarkable, aren't they?" Luca's voice tugs me back to his side, his grip on my hand tightening just a smidge.
 
"More than that," I reply, eyes still wide in wonder. "I can't believe I've never experienced something like this. It's... overwhelming, in the best possible way." I feel like a little girl. 
 
His smile meets my words, the corners of his eyes creasing in a way that suggests pure, unadulterated happiness. "I'm glad I could be a part of this with you."

We moved away, weaving through the crowd. Luca knows where he's going and is confident and direct. 

"Here," he says with a smile. 

We approach the baboon enclosure, the faint hint of a grin on Luca's face is my only clue to his mounting amusement. The enclosure is a captivating spectacle designed to replicate the primates' natural environment. A rich array of towering trees, their sturdy branches reaching up to the sky, fills the large, expansive space. The branches provide ample climbing and swinging opportunities for the baboons, evoking their love for heights and movement. A spread of boulders and rocks of varying sizes lay scattered across the enclosure. They serve as platforms for the baboons to lounge, play, or find solitude away from the group. Their nooks and crannies make fascinating hideouts, sparking curiosity and playfulness among the troupe's younger members. A slow-moving stream winds through the habitat, its gentle gurgles adding a soothing soundtrack to the setting. On warmer days, it doubles up as a refreshing dip for the baboons, a place to cool off and play in the water. The enclosure's boundaries are marked by a tall, robust fence. It ensures safety, both for the curious onlookers and the dynamic inhabitants of the space. At the same time, it allows an uninterrupted, immersive view of the fascinating creatures going about their routines, making it a truly memorable spectacle for the zoo's visitors. All around, lush greenery and vibrant flowers line the path leading up to the enclosure, painting a serene and pleasant backdrop to the lively and engaging activities of the baboons.
 
Luca and I stop near the front of the enclosure, where two baboons are perched on a nearby rock, their antics on full display. The first baboon is slightly larger, its muscular body covered in brownish-grey fur that glows under the warm sunlight. The second baboon is smaller, perhaps younger, its eyes gleaming with playful mischief. The larger baboon is sitting, it's back towards us, and its red bottom stands out like a beacon against its fur. The color is vibrant, a bold shade of red that seems almost unnatural but is a fascinating spectacle nonetheless. 
 
The smaller baboon moves about restlessly, occasionally poking the larger one, provoking some reaction. While not as vibrant, its bottom still sports a distinct shade of red, telling a story of its growing stature within the troupe. The younger one reaches out, smacking the larger one's red bottom before scampering off. The larger baboon gives a loud bark of surprise and anger, leaping into pursuit of its audacious playmate. Their energetic chase is a burst of rapid movement, bringing a ripple of laughter from the onlookers.
 
Luca turns to me and smiles. “See,” he says, pointing to the closest baboon. “Just like you.” He laughs. “Nice and red.”
 
I smile. I know he is teasing me, but knowing that my bruised backside is the result of this man is oddly arousing. I feel a tingle between my legs.
 
A young couple moves up next to us, their hands entwined and their faces bright with shared excitement. The woman is petite with delicate features accentuated by her high cheekbones and large, almond-shaped eyes. Her auburn hair cascades down her shoulders in loose waves, bouncing with every step she takes. She's dressed in a summery floral sundress that suits her. The man beside her is tall, lean, and short-cropped dark hair. He's wearing a button-down shirt that's left casually unbuttoned at the top, revealing a hint of a well-toned chest beneath. His jeans are comfortably worn, hugging his frame just right. His eyes are lively, mirroring the woman's excitement as they take in the antics of the baboons.
 
Luca turns to the man, his face serious. "Hey,” he says. The man looks at him. “Yesterday, I smacked her arse. She was being naughty." He points his thumb in my direction. "Now she looks like one of them." He nods towards the baboons with their vibrant red bottoms. “Her arse is bright red.”
 
The man blinks in surprise, obviously taken aback by Luca's unexpected statement. The woman's eyes widen, and a faint blush rises. The couple share a glance before excusing themselves and disappearing into the crowd as quickly as they can.
 
Luca bursts into laughter, the loud and hearty sound reverberating through the air and adding a spark of liveliness to the surroundings. I glance at him, unable to contain my giggles. Despite the blushing embarrassment, there's an undeniable sense of thrill in being claimed so boldly by him. It's a thrill I've never experienced before, and it leaves a warmth spreading through me, a warmth that only deepens my feelings for Luca.
 
He entwines his fingers with mine, his hold steady and reassuring, leading me away from the vivacious baboon exhibit. "There's something I want to show you," he murmurs, his words sparking a trail of anticipation that winds through my veins. His eyes, alight with boyish enthusiasm, leave me curiously excited about what lies ahead in our zoo escapade. We meander through the zoo's winding paths. 
 
We arrive at a seemingly forsaken food kiosk, its shabby appearance suggesting years of neglect. Its paint, once vibrant, now fades and peels, while cobwebs lace its corners like unwanted ornaments. My brows furrow in confusion as I try to make sense of this peculiar destination, the intrigue amplified by Luca's cryptic smile. As we round the kiosk, it reveals a secluded area tucked away from the zoo's typical hustle and bustle. 
 
"How did you find this place?" I ask.
 
He grins at my curiosity. "Back when I was in school, we came here on field trips. A bunch of us would sneak off from the group, find refuge here, and smoke cigarettes."
 
As we stand in the hidden nook, the sounds of the zoo fade away, replaced by a sense of tranquility. I look at Luca, and the depth of our connection again strikes me. In that secluded spot, it feels like we're the only two people in the world, sharing a secret that only we know. Luca moves so he's leaning his back against the wall of the kiosk. I watch as his hands drop to his trousers. For a second, I am confused at what he is doing. He unzips the fly and pushes his hand into the zip. He removes his hand and is holding his cock. It is erect and hard. It looks solid in his hand.
 
“Luca,” I say. I am shocked; we could be found at any moment. 
 
“Suck me,” he says.
 
I look into his eyes and down at his cock. I look around. We're hidden from view. A new thrill of excitement runs through me.
 
“That wasn’t a fucking request, Baboon,” he says. “Suck my fucking cock. I want to spurt my cum down your throat. On your knees.”
 
I look to the floor. The grass has grown long. The wind has blown rubbish behind the kiosk. I see old food wrappers and drink cans, some faded by the sun. Leaves have also been blown into the small space and lay rotting.
 
I hesitate. Part of me thinks this is stupid and wants to resist, but the thought is only fleeting. A different, stronger thought floods into my mind. I want to make this man happy, to turn off my brain and give him control. 

I obey. 

I kneel among the faded wrappers and rotting leaf litter. I feel like a teenage slut giving out blowjobs to older students behind the bike sheds. The shame and humiliation mingle with the need to obey Luca. The feeling is powerful. I like it. In a flash, it hits me. I am his slut. He owns me; I will do anything for this man. 
 
I take his cock in my hand, savoring the feeling of the hard flesh. I allow my tongue to flick out and lick away the pre-cum, creating a salty taste. Pleasure tingles from my groin. I am wet.
 
Luca’s dirty little slut.
 
I take his cock into my mouth. My lips engulf his head and then push down onto his shaft. I pull back, repeating the motion, allowing my tongue to flick his penis as my head moves. At the same time, I let my hand to move up and down the shaft. 
 
“Fuck,” he says. I can hear his breathing faster. “You look so fucking hot with my cock between those pretty lips.”
 
The words melt me. Something about the feeling of just giving in to him consumes me.
 
I suck him deeper. My mouth is hungry for him. I cup his balls and allow the shaft to slip in. I hear his sharp intake of breath as the tip of my tongue reaches around the head of his cock.
 
“Yes,” he says. “I want to come in my slut’s mouth.”
 
I move faster, my tongue, lips, and fingers all working to excite him. I want him to cum. I want his seed to shoot into me. I want him to use my mouth. I want it.
 
“I'm going to cum,” he says.
 
I slow down a little, matching his movement. He lets out a long moan and in a flash, my mouth is filled with his hot lumpy cum. I control my breathing as he shoots into my throat. I wait as it gushes into my mouth. Savoring the taste of the warm fluid, allowing it to linger in my mouth. When finished, he pulls out his cock and looks at me. I let his warm cum slip down my throat.
 
“Come here,” he says, his hand under my chin.
 
I stand, and he kisses me. My wet pussy tingles as the salty taste of his cum mixes in our mouths. I know he can taste himself.
 
“Good girl,” he says. “You'll get your treat later.”
 
I like being a good girl as much as I like being his slut.
 
Luca places his still hard cock back in his trousers and takes my hand. We reemerge from behind the kiosk. He glances at his watch. “You ready to go?”
 
I am. I have enjoyed the visit, but we both know we still have work to do and final checks to be made to our preparation. “Yeah, let’s go home.” I smile at him.
 
My fingers lace seamlessly with Luca's, the familiarity of his touch causing a pleasant shiver to ripple across my skin. Together, we start our journey back through the colorful labyrinth of the zoo, leaving behind the thrill of the wild and the laughter of families still savoring their adventures.
 
As we exit the zoo, the sunlight dapples through the trees, casting long, playful shadows on the ground. Luca's car stands parked nearby.
 
"Wait a moment, Bella," Luca says, his voice cutting through my thoughts. "I need to have a quick word with the director."
 
His request draws a nod from me. "I'll wait in the car," I reply, offering him an understanding smile. He gives my hand a reassuring squeeze before letting go and walking away. I find myself watching him as he moves away, my thoughts lingering on our shared experiences, the hidden kiosk, the playful baboons, and the secret world we had created together in the zoo.
 
I turn and slide into the car's passenger seat. Sitting alone in the car, I welcome the silence, the quiet hum of the world outside offering a soothing contrast to the whirlwind of thoughts in my head. Just as I’m beginning to drift into a peaceful reverie, the abrupt buzz of my phone snaps me back to reality. My heart skips a beat as I glance at the screen, a message lighting up the display.

"I know who you are."
 
A sudden cold dread washes over me like a shadow abruptly swallowing the sun. My hands tremble as I grip the phone tighter, the words on the screen growing more ominous each time I read them. My mind starts racing, thoughts whirling like leaves in a storm. What does this mean? Who could have sent it? The implications of someone knowing my secret ignite a fear deep within me. I can feel my pulse pounding in my ears; the world outside is suddenly too loud, too bright.
 
In my peripheral vision, I see Luca returning. His carefree smile fades as he catches sight of me, and I tuck my phone away, tamping down my fear. I smile as he opens the car door, praying my panic isn't as transparent as it feels.
 
"Everything okay, Bella?" Luca asks as he settles into the driver’s seat, a hint of concern edging his voice.
 
I nod, swallowing hard. "Yes," I reply, hoping the tremor in my voice isn't too noticeable.
 
He studies me, his sharp eyes piercing through my feeble facade. I can tell he doesn't entirely believe me but doesn't press the matter. Instead, he turns the key in the ignition, the engine's low rumble filling the silence.

# Chapter 33
## Bella
 
The motorway zips beneath us, the pulse of passing streetlights casting fleeting shadows through the car. I sink my head against the chilled glass of the window. My tears have run their course, leaving only a numb void in their wake. I steal a glance at Luca. Silent, his attention anchored on the road. Every flicker of light from the streetlamps paints his face in sharp relief. The stark angles of his jawline, the prominence of his cheekbones, his disheveled dark hair lending an enticing roguish quality. His eyes, usually alight with mischief, now carry a somber, unyielding determination mirroring the gravity of his decisions. The display of strength in his broad shoulders, the assertive grip of his muscular arms on the steering wheel is compelling. His body, defined and sturdy under his fitted shirt.
 
Confusion spirals through me, entangling my thoughts into a knotted mess. I'm a policewoman, yet a witness to a crime I've yet to report. My duty, my oath, scream at me to dial up my superiors, to spill every detail. 

But Luca... I can't surrender him.
 
Vittorio, his thirst for revenge will be insatiable. It's a ticking time bomb. Soon, he'll piece together the puzzle, and chaos will ensue. 
 
With every sunrise that sees me on the run, my old life slips a bit more out of reach. Returning will become a mountain too steep to climb. The echo of my colleagues' voices, the bustle of the station, even the aroma of over-brewed coffee in the break room—fading, blurring into the realm of distant memories. And yet, there's Luca. He's brought a love into my life I'd never known existed. It’s an intoxicating blend of passion and comfort, the mere thought of which sends shivers of longing racing down my spine.
 
My mind starts to wander, flirting with the possibilities of a shared life.
 
I envision him as my constant, always at my side, ready to shield me from whatever life tosses our way. It feels like our paths were meant to intertwine like the strings of fate had us earmarked for one another. I can almost see us saying our vows, the air electric with love and devotion, our friends and family bearing witness. The radiance in Luca’s smile as he slides the wedding band onto my finger, our commitment inked in eternity. My reverie spins further, picturing us welcoming a child into our lives, a beautiful blend of our shared love and passion. We would be a family, a unit fortified by the trust and love that’s carried us through our darkest hours.
 
And… he did what he promised. 

He protected me. He could have let Bianca kill me, he could have shot me himself, he could have even killed Bianca and blamed it on me; all of these options would have meant he could return to his old life.
 
But he decided to protect me, to pick me.
 
That means something. It must mean something. 
 
My gaze flickers from Luca to the bag slumped on the back seat. To him, it houses a masterpiece, the answer to our prayers, our one-way ticket to a worry-free life. But it’s nothing but a charade, a farce that keeps us clinging to a false dawn. The painting, a counterfeit, is worthless. 

Taking a steadying breath, I attempt to marshal my thoughts and emotions. Luca’s gaze flicks to me, his face a tableau of concern. I coax a smile onto my face and lock my gaze with his.
 
“It will all be okay.”
 
"I know," I say.
 
“I know a place we will be safe.”

# Chapter 29
## Bella
 
I am staring at the door. To the side is a barely noticeable security panel. I plop my black backpack down, unzipping it to reveal my laptop. A strange cocktail of excitement and dread zips through my veins as I pull out the machine. I open it and turn it on. Its screen blinks to life.
 
I glance over my shoulder to see Luca in the shadows not far off; his shape shrouded in the dim night. He's coiled tight, a spring ready to snap at a moment's notice. I can feel his tension prickling the air as he stands guard, eyes skimming the area for the slightest inkling of trouble. I wanted him away from me as I tried to work out how the hell I was going to open this door. This alarm should be off and the door, ready to swing open. 

But plans go wrong.... 

I need to put on a show, make it look real. I play my part, fingers putting on an intricate ballet across the keyboard. I am just pressing random keys. I sense Luca is watching but can't look around.
 
The seconds stretch into a painfully slow eternity. 

I wait for a sign, anything. I hold my breath. 

"You ok?" Luca's hissed voice drifts to me. 

I turn, give him a thumbs up and look back at the screen.

"Come on," I say, my words a low whisper. 

Seconds tick by.

A wash of relief sweeps over me as the software flickers green.
 
"We're in," I murmur to Luca, attempting to keep the tremor out of my voice. I see him move toward me.
 
I stand in front of the door's keypad, my fingers poised to tap out the code. Then it hits me like a runaway train — I don't know the damn code. Panic grips me and I falter, stuck in a sticky pool of uncertainty.
 
Luca, now at my shoulder, spots my hesitation. "Everything alright, Bella? Do we have a problem?"
 
I aim for confidence. "Yeah, I'm good. Just need a moment. For err… the system to reset. I just need it to come back online."
 
“Oh, OK,” he says and looks behind him, checking. "Will it take long?"

"No," I say. I know have bought a few seconds thinking time.
 
Desperation kicks my brain into overdrive, searching for a code that Harrison might've slipped me. I scan my memory for a hit of the code? Was it written in all those files? How did I miss it?

The realization hits.

The alarm is off, the door is unlocked. 

A chuckle escapes my lips and I stab six random numbers into the keypad. I give the handle a go. It moves and the door swings open. I pause, ears straining for the shrill wail of an alarm.

Nothing. 
 
A smile dances across Luca's face. "Looks like the alarm's out, well done, Baboon."
 
I grin, tension fizzling out. "That nickname's not sticking around."
 
“Not your choice,” he says.
 
We both take out our flashlights. The beams of our lights dissect the dark, revealing the lean, no-nonsense pathway ahead. Its floor is of simple, weathered stone tiles designed to bear the brunt of working boots and heavy gear. The walls, dressed in neutral paint, are devoid of embellishments or art. A place of pure function, it strikes a stark contrast with the lavish grandeur we know awaits in the primary living spaces. Stepping into the austere corridor, we halt, our ears pricking up for any sounds—a giveaway shuffle or voices—that might hint at company. Nothing but our breaths punctuating the silence, the distant tick-tock of a clock. We tread towards the dining room, our steps whispering across the hard tiles.

We weave our way through the labyrinth until we stand before the grand ballroom's entrance. Despite our prior visits, the room transforms into a chilling spectacle under the blanket of night, our flashlights offering tantalizing peeks at its majesty. The towering ceilings intimidate us, their intricate plasterwork casting ominous shadows as our lights dance over them. The chandelier, usually ablaze with light, now looms like a sparkling, dormant arachnid, its crystals bouncing off feeble specks of light from our torches. The vast windows, shrouded by thick curtains, hold the moonlight at bay, submerging the room in near-impenetrable darkness. The burnished wooden floor only reveals itself in fragments, gleaming under the sporadic light of our torches. The walls, decked with refined damask wallpaper, feel as if they're closing in on us as we traverse the room, alert for any obstructions or indications of movement.
 
The room's grandeur instills a sense of awe in me, even though our limited torchlight only uncovers bits and pieces. The room's luxurious essence is evident in the towering ceilings, complex moldings, and elaborate chandeliers. But my focus snaps to the artwork we have come to steal. I note the absence of security beams or apparent protection. I retrieve my laptop and launch the fake program for a second time. The screen comes alive with lines of cryptic code, complex algorithms, and commands churning together. I glance at Luca, checking if my performance holds up, and find him watching the door we have just entered by. The program eventually flashes green, signifying the 'deactivation' of the security system. 

"All clear," I declare, injecting confidence into my voice.
 
Luca nods. His flashlight sweeps across the dim room, highlighting an aged wooden chair hiding in a murky corner. The intricate carvings etched onto the chair appear to narrate an untold tale, but we have no time to appreciate its artistry. He strides over, his footfalls bouncing off the expansive room, and retrieves the chair, bringing it back to the painting. Luca adjusts the chair in front of the piece of art, ensuring it's steady on the antiquated, gleaming wooden floor. As he does this, I see sweat starting to dot his forehead - a clear indication of the enormity of what we're doing. He pulls out a small, slim blade from his pocket, incredibly sharp and ideal for the delicate task ahead. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Luca mounts the chair, casting an elongated, misshapen shadow on the wall behind. He lifts the knife and starts to excise the painting from its decorative frame. The blade cuts smoothly, almost seamlessly through the canvas, under the control of Luca's firm, practiced hand. He makes his final cut with precision, and the severed canvas is removed from its frame. Stepping down from the chair, I can see the relief washing over his face, a sentiment mirrored by my own. Luca rolls the canvas and tucks it into the black bag, ensuring it's secure and safe from harm. As he zips the bag shut, I can feel the adrenaline coursing through us both, the magnitude of our actions sinking in.
 
Luca takes the walkie-talkie, pressing the transmit button, his voice steady amidst the heightened tension. "Eagle, this is Falcon. The nest is empty. Over."
 
A brief spell of static follows before Rico's voice responds through the speaker. "Understood, Falcon. I'll be ready at the rendezvous point. Over and out."
 
“The nest is empty?” I ask, with a hint of a smile.
 
Luca turns towards me, grinning. “It's pro talk.”
 
We double back, our flashlights lighting the way through the mansion's darkened corridors. Our hearts pound in sync as we return to the side door we initially entered, the weight of the situation pressing upon us. Emerging into the chill night air, we leave the tense atmosphere of the mansion behind. The cloak of darkness shrouds us, shielding us from any onlookers as we retrace our path to the wall we scaled earlier. 
 
We reach the car, our breath frosting in the cold night air, hearts still pounding from the adrenaline rush. Luca opens the door for me, and I slide into the passenger seat, the cool leather against my skin a sharp contrast. He shuts the door and moves to the driver's side. He reaches for the ignition.
 
"Hold on," I say. His gaze turns towards me, filled with confusion and worry. The soft illumination from the dashboard highlights his striking features, causing my heart to flutter. "There's something I need to tell you."

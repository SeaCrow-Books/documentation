# Chapter 12
## Luca
 
The gravel crunches under the wheels of my car as I bring it to a halt outside the nondescript warehouse. Its imposing steel structure is an aging monument to some forgotten era of industry. Next to our car, my father's sleek black Bentley shines. The sight of it triggers a cocktail of emotions in me - frustration, apprehension, determination. I kill the engine and we step out into the cold afternoon air. The scent of damp earth and the faint, metallic hint of the river nearby mingle.

As we enter the warehouse, I glance at Bella. She's dressed simply as always, her choice of attire purposefully unassuming, my father was right, its almost boyish. The loose jeans and baggy sweater do little to detract from the inherent femininity of her figure. Bella is stunning, even in her frumpiness or perhaps because of it. However, something about her this morning is different. She seems distant, caught in thoughts she's not ready to share. But there's also a spark in her eyes, a certain light that wasn't there yesterday. 

It's... enchanting.
 
I realise that I want to fuck her. Not make love to her, but fuck her. To take her, to push my hand between her legs and bury my fingers deep into her wet pussy. To hear her gasp…
 
I take a breath.
 
Bella and I stride into the warehouse. The air is thick with anticipation. A large table dominates the centre of the room, strewn with maps and photographs. My father and Rico occupy two of the chairs, their faces stern and contemplative, their silence almost palpable. We slide into the remaining seats, the scraping noise of chair against concrete the only disruption to the heavy silence. Bella looks around, her brows furrowed.
 
"Where's Bianca?" Her voice echoes in the vast space, the question hanging heavy in the air.
 
My father grunts, his attention never wavering from the papers before him. "I'm allowed to have a meeting without her once in a while." His voice is terse, laced with a hint of annoyance I can't quite decipher. He continues to shuffle through the papers, but his movements are more aggressive than before. The question has affected him. Something's off, a change in his demeanor that wasn't there before. But before I can probe further, he looks up from the documents, his steely gaze meeting ours. "Let's get started," he says. “This will not take long.”
 
He reaches into his jacket pocket and withdraws a sleek envelope, sliding it across the table towards me. My fingers curl around the edges, pulling out the crisp, cream-colored card. The words 'Mr. and Mrs. Vella' are scripted across the top in looping, gold calligraphy.
 
A chuckle escapes my lips as I slide the invitation across the table to Bella. "Looks like we're married," I quip, trying to lighten the somber mood that had fallen over us.
 
Her lips curve into a smile as she reads the invitation, a lightness flickering in her eyes that wasn't there before. "Well then, I'll need a ring," she jests, playing along.
 
Without missing a beat, my father reaches into his other pocket, pulling out a small, ring box. He hands it over to me and I flip open the lid. Inside, nestled against the plush cushioning, is a diamond ring glittering under the harsh fluorescent lights of the warehouse.
 
"Is it real?" I ask, eyeing the sparkling gem with a mixture of surprise and suspicion.
 
My father shakes his head, a wry smile playing on his lips. "No, it's a fake. Just like our story," he replies. "But for the sake of the job, you two better make it look as real as possible."
 
As I hold the ring, a vision unspools in my mind... 

There it is a house nestled in the heart of the country, sunlight streaming through the large windows and spilling onto polished wooden floors. Two kids, their laughter filling the air, chase each other around a sprawling garden laden with blooming flowers. Bella, her hair loose, laughter dancing in her eyes, is chasing after them. She turns towards me, her smile radiant under the sun, and in that instant, I see a glimpse of what could be—of what I ache for deep within me.
 
The normalcy. The simplicity. The contentment that a life with Bella could bring.

This rush of feelings confuses me, stirs up a longing I'd thought I'd buried long ago, and I'm caught off guard, the fantasy knocking me off balance. I find myself drawn back into reality, the ring gleaming at me as a reminder of the make-believe scenario we're about to enter. I close the box with a snap, hiding the gem and along with it, my unsettling, unexpected emotions.
 
With a smirk, I turn to Bella, forcing the words out like it's all just another part of this elaborate scheme. "Will you fake marry me?" The question feels heavy, even in jest, and a pang of longing echoes deep within me.
 
Our eyes lock for a moment. Something unspoken passes between us. She’s all sharp edges and wild spirit, wrapped in a woman's body who could drive any man to distraction. For a fleeting moment, I wish it were real. I could feel her hand's warmth in mine, not just for this ruse but beyond it.
 
"Not if you were the last man alive," Bella retorts, her voice brimming with feigned disdain. Rico chortles in amusement, breaking the momentary tension.
 
Bella takes the ring and slides the ring onto her finger with a theatrical flourish. She looks back at me, a playful glint in her eyes, and holds up her hand to showcase the ring. "How's it look, fake husband?" she teases. I can't help the flutter in my chest.
 
My father’s gruff voice interrupts the tender moment, dragging us all back to reality. "Alright, you lovebirds, let's get down to business."
 
I glance at Bella, my gaze drawn to the glinting band on her finger. A strange sense of longing seizes me, a whirlpool of emotions I don’t understand and certainly didn’t ask for. I can't seem to peel my gaze away from the ring, now a glaring reminder of what could and will never be. Suddenly, the room feels too small, the air too thick, the reality of our situation crashing down on me like a wave. I clear my throat, trying to clear my mind, forcing myself to focus on the impending meeting. 
 
“Ok,” says my father. “Here’s the plan. Let’s keep it simple. As far as anyone is concerned you two have every right to be at the party, if you don't do anything to raise suspicion it will all go smoothly. Remember, this is a reconnaissance mission, so it will be easy. You two will arrive at the party thirty minutes after it begins," he starts, his gaze flickering between Bella and me. "You will mingle with the guests, blend in, act like you belong. Your job is to get a lay of the land and take as many photographs and videos as possible. Focus on the manor's layout, the security measures in place, the entrances, exits - every detail matters." He punctuates each instruction with a pointed look, ensuring we understand the gravity of the task. "And, most importantly, the painting. We need to know exactly where it is, how it's secured... Everything. And then," he finishes, sitting back and folding his arms across his chest, "you will act like good little party-goers and leave." His gaze rests on us, his sharp eyes searching our faces for any signs of doubt or uncertainty. "Any questions?" he asks, his tone suggesting that he expects none.
 
I glance at Bella, a silent confirmation passing between us. We understand what we have to do. No questions.
 
“Seems straight forward,” I say.
 
"I'll be waiting nearby in case something goes south," Rico says, his voice serious. He runs his hand through his hair, a frown etching deep lines on his forehead. "I'll be tooled up." He pauses, a grim smile flashing across his rugged face. "But the last thing I want is to gatecrash a high society party waving around a Glock 19." 
 
With a swift glance at his watch, my father rises from his chair, straightening out his well-tailored suit. "Alright, that seems to be that," he announces in his gravelly voice, his gaze scanning over us. "I have a tee booked in an hour. Luca, I need you to go over the plans with Rico, cover every possible angle."
 
His dark eyes then shift to Bella, studying her for a moment. "Bella, anything specific you'll be keeping an eye on at the event?" he asks, his tone as authoritative as ever.
 
Bella, seeming momentarily taken aback, hesitates before responding. "I... I'll need to inspect the security measures around the painting. To ensure it's as expected," she stammers out, her usual confidence seemingly shaken.
 
Something about her reaction makes me uneasy, her vagueness out of character. I see Rico look over to her, a questioning looking flashing over his face but it is hidden.
 
My father and Rico rise from the table, the sound of the chairs scraping against the concrete floor echoing through the vast warehouse. The meeting has ended, the plan set, the roles clear. Bella and I are left alone in the cavernous space. There's a silence that settles between us, filling the void left by my father and Rico. Bella seems lost in thought, her gaze distant, her hands fiddling with the fake diamond ring. There's a change in her, an unfamiliar air of aloofness that starkly contrasts her usual fiery spirit.
 
"Everything okay?" I ask.
 
Her eyes flick to mine, coming back from wherever her thoughts had taken her. "Yeah," she murmurs, her voice distant. "Just... processing," she adds, her gaze drifting down to the invitation lying on the table between us.
 
It would be easy to take her words at face value and attribute the change in her demeanor to the imminent danger we're about to enter. But something nags at me, a feeling that there's more to her distant gaze and carefully chosen words than meets the eye.

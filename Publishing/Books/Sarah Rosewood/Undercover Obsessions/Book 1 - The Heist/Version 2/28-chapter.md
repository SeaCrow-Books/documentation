# Chapter 28
## Luca
 
I sit behind the wheel of car, soaking in the hushed vibes of the secluded lane. The tight road, hemmed in by towering, twisted trees, feels like a cloistered cocoon. The night swallows all but the spectral silhouettes, smothering even the subtlest sounds. In the absence of streetlights, the blackness amplifies the solitude. Within the confines of the car, the dashboard illuminates the space with a subtle, cozy radiance, dappling Bella and me in soft hues. The quiet hangs heavy between us, interrupted only by our shared breathing and the hushed symphony of rustling leaves in the distance. As we wait, anticipation chokes the air.
 
I shift my gaze to Bella, her face dimly lit by the faint glow from the dashboard, her silence strikes me. Her eyes seem a million miles away, tangled in a maze of thoughts. A ripple of worry courses through me.
 
"Hey, everything alright?" I venture.
 
She pivots towards me, her gaze locking with mine. For a fleeting moment, she seems to grapple with the choice to open up, then nods, offering a feeble smile. "Yes, I'm good. Just... a bit on edge, I guess," her response is barely a murmur.
 
Reaching out, I cover her hand with mine, a gentle pressure seeking to comfort. "Nerves are part of the game," I say. "But remember, we've dissected this plan to the last detail. I trust you. We've got this."
 
Her smile steadies, gaining a hint of resolve as she returns the nod. "You're right. We've got this."
 
A flush of pride warms me at her tenacity, yet a faint uncertainty niggles at the edge of my thoughts. Something feels off-kilter, but I can't quite identify it. With a deep exhale, I shove the unsettling thought to the back of my mind.
 
"Okay," I declare, my eyes drawn to the watch on my wrist. "Almost go-time. A few minutes."
 
My thoughts skid back to Rico. His doubts about Bella had resurfaced. I understand that the foundation of our operation lies in trust among the crew. The sensation of unease clings, but I shove it aside, recalibrating my focus on the imminent task. 
 
I glance at my watch. "Let's roll," I say, meeting Bella's affirmative nod. We step out of the car, collect our gear, slip on the masks, and venture down the isolated, shadowy country lane.
 
The darkness is oppressive, the moon cloaked behind dense cloud cover, and the cool air carries the musky aroma of the wet soil. Leaves rustle as we walk and the crunch of our footsteps are the only sounds punctuating the silence. We scale the low wall that indicates the boundary for the house and continue our journey across the sprawling green. The dewy grass underfoot and the towering trees standing guard make the journey feel like navigating a shadowy labyrinth. The grand house now comes into view, its majestic and menacing silhouette dominating the darkness. I exchange a resolute look with Bella before pushing forward towards the mansion. We hunker down behind a thick bush near the building's flank, ducking low. 
 
"Okay," I murmur, the words scarcely parting my lips. "We'll rehearse the plan once more, just for clarity. We'll infiltrate through the side entrance. Bella, you're on lock and alarm duty. Speed and precision are crucial. We're running on borrowed time."
 
Bella nods and looks towards the building. Studying Bella, her laser focus, her face a portrait of resolve, I'm blindsided by her beauty. Right now, she appears as a poised, seasoned woman, geared up to tackle any challenge hurled at her by life. Her valor and grit radiate an irresistible magnetism, making it almost impossible not to be drawn toward her. Despite the escalating tension, I am overwhelmed by a wave of admiration and desire for her. An urge to lean over and capture her lips. To explore her form. An unexpected arousal takes hold.
 
I banish the feeling to the back of my mind.
 
Inhaling, I extract the walkie-talkie, and press the communication button. "Eagle, this is Falcon. Are you in position? Over."
 
There's a brief lapse before Rico's voice scratches out from the speaker. "Falcon, Eagle here. I'm positioned and primed. Over." 
 
"Roger that, Eagle. We're commencing the infiltration. Await further directives. Over and out," I respond. A suppressed giggle dances on Bella's lips. "What?" I ask.
 
"The code names?" she asks, her grin undimmed. "Aren't they a touch… er… whimsical? Like a subplot from a corny espionage film."
 
"They have a role," I say. "They're instrumental in preserving our anonymity and ensuring operation security."
 
Her smile persists. "What's my alias then?"
 
Her curiosity draws a smirk from me. "Your call sign is Foxfire. It encapsulates your essence."
 
Bella chuckles. "I'm fond of it. Foxfire. Better than Baboon."
 
We traverse toward the mansion, a mammoth, enigmatic silhouette under the ebony blanket of the night sky. The rustling wind through the trees forms an ominous symphony to our nearing. We maneuver around the mansion's rear, maintaining a low profile, hugging the darkness, and eventually seeking shelter behind a wall merely meters from the house. Entwined in thick ivy, the wall offers a natural concealment, while the moist soil beneath seeps through our clothes.
 
As we huddle, our hearts drumming a frantic rhythm, a dog's bark pierces the distance. We freeze. After several heart-stopping moments, the barking ebbs away, and we exchange sighs of relief. The daunting mansion stands before us, its dark windows resembling vacant, unblinking gazes. We step forward, crossing the last few minutes to the door.
 
I turn to Bella. "We're here," I murmur, my breath crystallizing in the crisp nocturnal air. "I need you to gain access through this door and neutralize the alarm."
 
She acknowledges with a nod. "I need to hack their WiFi," she declares. "Give me some space and keep an eye out." She points to a place at the corner of the building, it's well-chosen and I can see clearly if anyone is coming. I move away and leave her to work.

# Chapter 7
## Bella
 
As the taxi pulls into a sleek, polished concrete driveway, I can't help but gawk at the modern townhouse that looms before me. It has sleek lines, angular architecture, and expansive glass windows. An epitome of contemporary design, the building is rendered in a gleaming white that contrasts with the duller colors of the neighboring structures. Its three levels each boast expansive, floor-to-ceiling windows that give an enticing peek into the luxurious interior.
 
I pay the taxi driver and hoist my suitcase out of the trunk, my gaze lingering on the serene surroundings. The townhouse sits comfortably in a neat, well-tended street with calm and order air. A meticulously maintained front yard separates the house from the driveway, lending a layer of charm to the property.
 
Hauling my suitcase up the stone steps leading to the front door, I steel myself.
 
This isn't just some hotel room or temporary lodging. This is where I'll be living and working for the foreseeable future. The reality of my situation settles in like a heavyweight. There’s no turning back now. For a moment, I stand there, looking at the gleaming silver bell set into the front door frame. My finger hovers over it, my mind buzzing with a mixture of anticipation and dread. I know what this means, pressing that bell signifies my commitment to this dangerous game.
 
I press the bell.
 
There's a brief pause and the door swings open, revealing Luca standing in the doorway. He's dressed casually for the first time since I met him. He's wearing a plain black fitted t-shirt that clings to his muscular torso and faded jeans that hug his lean hips and strong thighs. His dark hair is slightly tousled as if he's just run his fingers through it, and his stubble has grown a bit thicker, giving him a rugged, masculine appeal.
 
The sight of him catches me off guard. There's a disarming casualness about him that I haven't seen before. His usual air of authority and control is replaced by an effortless, even more potent charm. His deep-set eyes meet mine, and there's a glint in them, a mischievous spark that sets my pulse racing. My eyes linger on his arms, strong and muscular, veins visible under the taut skin. My gaze travels back up to his face, and I take in his sharp jawline, the way his stubble accentuates it, and his full, expressive lips. This Luca is a stark contrast to the one I've known before, and I have to admit, I am impressed... and more than a little attracted.
 
"Shall we?" he says, his voice pulling me out of my thoughts. He steps aside, allowing me inside. With a quick, silent nod, I step into Luca's world.
 
I set down my bag in the grand entryway. Luca picks it up with a smile. The hallway is spacious and modern, with minimalist design elements that perfectly complement the elegant architecture of the house. The white marble floor inlaid with black granite, gleams under the soft glow of recessed lighting. The sleek, straight lines of a slim black console table draw the eye, upon which a single crystal vase holding a single, lily adds a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome setting. There's a particular detail, however, that catches my eye instantly. Adorning the walls are several beautiful paintings, expertly framed and lit to emphasize their unique colors and brushwork. Each piece is clearly chosen with care, some abstract and others more traditional. They seem out of place in this sleek, modern setting, but they also add a touch of warmth and personality to the space. It's an intriguing contrast that I hadn't expected from Luca.
 
"Follow me," Luca calls over his shoulder, leading me further into his home. I follow, curiosity piqued, eager to uncover more about this man through the home he's built.
 
As we traverse the hallway, Luca points to a closed door on our left. "That's my study," he says. His tone makes it clear it's his private domain and I'm not invited. We continue down the hall, and he gestures to another door, slightly ajar. "That's the washroom," he states, "but it's currently out of action."
 
I take a brief peek inside to find an array of ceramic tiles scattered around, some adhering to the walls while others are stacked haphazardly in open boxes. The room smells of fresh adhesive and plaster. The renovation project appears to be in its early stages. I can't help but wonder why he's chosen this specific moment to renovate.
 
"Will that be an issue?" he asks, a note of irritation creeping into his voice. I shake my head, reassuring him that it's not a problem. He nods. “I wasn’t expecting company.” His expression unreadable, and we continue on our tour.
 
We make our way into the sleek, modern kitchen. The gleaming countertops are polished granite, while the cabinets are a deep, warm chestnut. A large island dominates the center of the room, accompanied by a set of high stools. The kitchen looks spotless, and I wonder if Luca ever cooks or if he dines out every night. He leads me up the stairs from the kitchen, his hand lightly grazing the polished wooden banister. He points to a few small devices mounted on the walls.
 
"That's the CCTV system," he says, his voice echoing in the hollow stairwell. "But they've been playing up recently. I was waiting for Rico to take a look at them." He pauses for a moment, turning to look at me. "But, you're pretty good with tech stuff, right?" he asks. I nod. He gives a nonchalant shrug, as if the malfunctioning CCTV is no big deal, but I know better. "Maybe you could take a look?" he suggests, his tone casual.
 
I hesitate for a moment. "Sure." After all, this was part of the job. 
 
Luca leads me to a smaller door, slightly ajar. He opens it fully, revealing a comfortably sized bedroom. "This is your room," he says, his tone casual, as if he's used to having guests in his home.
 
The room is a pleasing blend of modern and traditional design. A plush king-sized bed takes up one side of the room, covered in crisp white sheets and a cascade of plush pillows. Beside it is a bedside table, the lamp atop it giving off a warm, inviting light. A sleek flat-screen television is mounted on the wall opposite the bed, and a stylish armchair sits in one corner, perfect for reading or lounging. What catches my attention, though, are the older pieces of furniture scattered around the room. An antique writing desk, its dark wood polished to a high shine, sits beneath one of the windows. On it, a collection of framed photographs, their unfamiliar subjects, starkly contrasts the otherwise modern surroundings. One piece, however, draws my attention most. It's a full-length mirror, its gilded frame chipped and worn in places. Despite its age, the mirror's glass is clear and unblemished, reflecting the room with almost eerie precision. It's propped up against the wall in one corner of the room as if it's been placed there temporarily. The room is complete with a private en suite bathroom, the door to it ajar, revealing a glimpse of marble countertops and shiny chrome fixtures.
 
"Make yourself at home," Luca says, stepping back into the hallway. "Alright, I'm going to make some coffee," Luca says, giving me a brief nod as he turns to leave the room. His gaze lingers on me for a moment longer than necessary, adding an odd tension to the atmosphere.
 
The door clicks shut behind him, leaving me alone in the quiet room. I glance around, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings once more before moving towards my suitcase. I unzip my suitcase, revealing neatly folded clothes, toiletries, and other personal items. There's a clinical precision to how everything is packed, a habit developed from years of living a transient life, moving from one place to another. Halfway through unpacking, my hand lands on something cold and metallic. Pulling it out, I find the burner phone. A knot forms in my stomach as I consider its implications. 
 
I head to the ensuite and lock the door. I turn on the phone and wait a moment. It flashes into life. I check the charge and seeing it is fully charged, I turn it off and go back into the bedroom.
 
I need to hide it, but where? 

Glancing around the room, my eyes land on the full-length mirror propped up against the corner. The frame is old and ornate, made of solid wood with intricate carvings - it's out of place amidst the room's modern décor, but I'm beginning to see its potential. Crossing the room, I inspect the mirror more closely. It's heavy, but I manage to shift it, revealing a small gap between the wall and the frame. It's a risk, but I carefully slide the burner phone behind the mirror with a quick glance over my shoulder to ensure I'm still alone. The mirror settles back into place, and to any casual observer, the room is just as it was.

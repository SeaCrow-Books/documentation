These are the idea and outlines for book 3, which will be called The Hunt. 


- The book starts with Vittirio on the run in Europe. His accounts have been frozen by the police so he is desperate. However, he has the van Gough painting. This is a fake but he is unaware of this. This plan is to sell the painting and return to the UK. He is keen to get revenge from Luca and Bella for the death of Bianca and Rico (though Rico is alive he is unaware of this), the fact he was stabbed and had to gone on the run. He is now driven by the need for revenge. 
- Inspector Harrison is obsessed with arresting Vittorio. He was involved in the case of trying to arrest Vittorio for the murder of his wife. He suspect that he was the killer but was unable to prove it. This become a huge source of pain for Harrison, not only was it a professional failure but he was baited by Vittorio both publically and privately. From this moment he become obsessed with bringing vittorio to justice. He has tried and failed to arrest Vittorio on several occasions. He is now nearing the end of his career and has been given permission to have one more attempt at arresting Vittoiro. However, the gangster is currently on the run in Europe and he needs to trick him to return to the UK to arrest him. He has come up with the idea that he can uses Vittorio's desire to revenge against him. He has offered Luca and Bella a deal where they will act as bait to tempt Vittorio to return. Luca will start to openly rebuild the Vittorio crime family, an act that is both blatant but acts directly against Vittoiro's legacy. Harrison know Vittorio is a proud man and will be unable to dismiss what he considers an act of respect from Luca. It is a dangerous plan since Vittorio will kill both given the chance. Harrison is hugly conflicted with placing Bella in danger. He understands he is asking too much of Balla. However, he is using Bella's own drive to please the memery of her dead farther and become an effective police officer. He also know Bella feels that she needs to make amends for what happened with Luca. 
- Harrison comes up with a plan that Luca will return to London and reestablish the gang, Bella will be his right hand assistant. Luca will be vocal about his father Vittorio being dead and the gang is now his. This will anger Vittorio and force him to return to the UK.
- Vittorio takes the bait. Harrison is aware of Vittorio's bank accounts and they are being tracked. Harrison uses this information to follow Vittorio's journey. At first, he knows he is in Paris. Then when Luca starts to reappear, Vittorio is tracked to the Northern Coast of France. He then drops out of view. Later, Harrison gets a top off that Vittorio is back in the UK but he knows he is being tracked and is being careful. Perhaps Luca thinks her sees his farther in the run up to the climax. He will then stalk Vittorio before picking the final moment to strike. 
- In a climax scene, Vittirio will come out of hiding and try to kill Luca and Bella. He will be caught. 
- When Harrison has Vittorio in custody he has a problem. He needs physical evidence to arrest Vittrio for the murder of his first wife. Luca is unable to provide this evidence, but then remembers that Rico had mentioned that Vittorio had buried Bianca's body and that Vittorio had know where to go. Harrisoin suspects that if they find Bianca, they will find his first wife. Harrison take Luca to interview Rico. They offer him a deal and urge him to give up the location. Ricco's nurse tells Rico that if he really is a changed man he'll 'do the right thing'. Ricco decided to give up Vittorio and tells Harrison the location, he finds two bodies. Vittorio is arrested and charged. 
  





## Thoughts 

- Luca restarts Rico's drug gang, run in with the Lituanians
- Dave and Bella will they wont they
- Luca rebuild as a man, Dave is a threat, he is forced to become masculine, (dave and gangs) - act 1, Bella demands he be vulrenable and loving act 2, forms into a balance man - act 3
- Bella's arc?
- Dave's arc?
- What happened to the paiting, could we lure Vittorio out. 


the hideout, the hunt?

harrison off book, timeline to get it done



Luca learns he kills his wife. Rico is a key here. This is what make Luca grass his dad. 

Bella and Dave need to be alone at some point early in the book. 

vittorioi increasingly desperate and need to return, painting stays cetnre stage. 

rico sets up vittorio with bianca (stay out of prison, betray vittior, in love with hurse) - triggers Luca for mum - enough evdience - get Vittorio in UK - vittriorio via fishing boat - hunts down Luca - showdown 


spin off - harrison offers deal, rico says no, nurse do it for me. rico choice love or loyalty. Don't no until the end - last scene in Rico's choice/ 
Rico knows where they are and sent guy to get the painitng, thought he could get Vittoiro of Luca's back - tells harriosn or the nurse. Rico mught know from the start. Rico was protecting Luca, his hand was forced. 



act 1 - ganager shit
act 2 - Bella, dave, Luca triang;e
act 3 - Luca becoming balanced - gives up everything to prove tyo Bella and Harrsion he's done. epilouige house in France 


end of act 1 something must happen that is ganger shit but Bella stops him - killing dabe? 

bella arc
A1 - start being assertive, realises she's not a cop, need to resetablsh her person intregity - becomes luca's consuoiance. 

A2 - Bella and dave alone, Bella thinks she wants dave and that life, a will they wont they thing. At end for some reason wants Luca, perhaps luca dose something to win her over. Some kind of ultimayaum, must leave it all behind, she has to live a clean life. She can go with dave but it become Luca's chice. 

end of act 2 luca thinks dave has fucked Bella, beats hte shot out of him, goes to kill him., Bella gives an ultuiamted, has to be luca's chocie not to, rebuuild from that point. Luca relises he has to change. 

When luca goes back to gangster life he loves the stability and slips back into a role of control. 

luca has a secret stash when he returns to normal live

At somepoint, they realise that Harrison is playing fasta nd lsoe and they canout of it.

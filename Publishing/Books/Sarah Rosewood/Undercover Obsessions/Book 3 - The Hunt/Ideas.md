These are the idea and outlines for book 3, which will be called The Hunt. 


- The book start with Vittirio on the run in Europe. His accounts have been frozen by the police so he is desperate. However, he has the van Gough painting. This is a fake but he is unaware of this. This plan is to sell the painting and return to the UK. He is keen to get revenge from Luca and Bella for the death of Bianca and Rico (though Rico is alive he is unaware of this), the fact he was stabbed and had to gone on the run. He is now driven by the need for revenge.
- Inspector Harrison is obsessed with arresting Vittorio. He is certain that Vittorio killed his first wife but is unable to prove it. He has tried and failed to arrest Vittorio on several occasions. He is now nearing the end of his career and has been given permission to have one more attempt at arresting Vittoiro. However, the gangster is currently on the run in Europe and he needs to trick him to return to the UK to arrest him. He has come up with the idea that he can uses Vittorio's desire to revenge against him. He has offered Luca and Bella a deal where they will act as bait to tempt Vittorio to return. It is a dangerous plan since Vittorio will kill both given the chance.

- Harrison comes up with the idea that Vittorio will return to the UK if he sees Luca claiming his gang and old business. This means that he is willing to allow Luca to do this, but only if Dave is part of it to keep an eye on him. He no longer trusts Bella but she needs to stay to also wind up Vittorio. 
- Harrision is trying to get evidence to convict Vittorio, the problem is that he's not done enough. He comes back to the plan  




## Thoughts 

- Luca restarts Rico's drug gang, run in with the Lituanians
- Dave and Bella will they wont they
- Luca rebuild as a man, Dave is a threat, he is forced to become masculine, (dave and gangs) - act 1, Bella demands he be vulrenable and loving act 2, forms into a balance man - act 3
- Bella's arc?
- Dave's arc?
- What happened to the paiting, could we lure Vittorio out. 


the hideout, the hunt?

harrison off book, timeline to get it done



Luca learns he kills his wife. Rico is a key here. This is what make Luca grass his dad. 

Bella and Dave need to be alone at some point early in the book. 

vittorioi increasingly desperate and need to return, painting stays cetnre stage. 

rico sets up vittorio with bianca (stay out of prison, betray vittior, in love with hurse) - triggers Luca for mum - enough evdience - get Vittorio in UK - vittriorio via fishing boat - hunts down Luca - showdown 


spin off - harrison offers deal, rico says no, nurse do it for me. rico choice love or loyalty. Don't no until the end - last scene in Rico's choice/ 
Rico knows where they are and sent guy to get the painitng, thought he could get Vittoiro of Luca's back - tells harriosn or the nurse. Rico mught know from the start. Rico was protecting Luca, his hand was forced. 



act 1 - ganager shit
act 2 - Bella, dave, Luca triang;e
act 3 - Luca becoming balanced - gives up everything to prove tyo Bella and Harrsion he's done. epilouige house in France 


end of act 1 something must happen that is ganger shit but Bella stops him - killing dabe? 

bella arc
A1 - start being assertive, realises she's not a cop, need to resetablsh her person intregity - becomes luca's consuoiance. 

A2 - Bella and dave alone, Bella thinks she wants dave and that life, a will they wont they thing. At end for some reason wants Luca, perhaps luca dose something to win her over. Some kind of ultimayaum, must leave it all behind, she has to live a clean life. She can go with dave but it become Luca's chice. 

end of act 2 luca thinks dave has fucked Bella, beats hte shot out of him, goes to kill him., Bella gives an ultuiamted, has to be luca's chocie not to, rebuuild from that point. Luca relises he has to change. 

When luca goes back to gangster life he loves the stability and slips back into a role of control. 

luca has a secret stash when he returns to normal live

At somepoint, they realise that Harrison is playing fasta nd lsoe and they canout of it.

The early morning sunlight filters through the garden, casting long shadows and turning the dew-speckled leaves into shimmering silver. A low mist hangs over everything. Luca stands there, a silhouette against the nascent light, looking down the narrow lane beyond our cottage, his eyes straining into the murk. He seems lost in thought, a lone figure against the backdrop of this peaceful morning. Yet there is an underlying tension in his posture, a readiness that speaks volumes about the imminent journey that awaits us.
 
My hands tighten around the warmth of the tea mug, its familiar weight offering a strange sort of comfort. From my vantage point in the open kitchen door, I can't help but feel a pang of sadness. This cottage has been our sanctuary, our hideaway from the relentless pursuit that's been our life for the past months. Leaving it behind feels like abandoning a part of ourselves, a part of our shared history that's irreplaceably precious.
 
"Luca," I call out, my voice barely more than a whisper, yet he turns. There's a comforting familiarity in how his eyes meet mine across the distance, a silent acknowledgment of our shared anxiety.
 
He walks towards me. When he reaches me, he wraps an arm around my waist and draws me close. Our bodies meld together, a fitting puzzle that's found its match. His breath is warm against my temple as he whispers, "It's almost time."
 
I nod, placing my free hand over his, resting against my waist like he's my lifeline amidst the stormy seas. We both sip our tea, a wordless toast to the journey that awaits us. And anxiety remains even as our gazes meet, sharing a silent moment of understanding. But, as the sun rises higher, casting away the lingering shadows, I find a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty. We're leaving behind a piece of our heart here, but we're carrying the most important part - our love, determination, and resilience. And with those, I know we're ready to face whatever comes our way.
 
My gaze softens as I look at Luca, his profile illuminated by the early morning sunlight. It's hard to reconcile the man standing beside me now with the one I had first met. That man was distant, aloof. His cold eyes and sharper words had erected an impenetrable fortress around him, keeping everyone at bay. I had hated him for that, despised how he treated me, like I was another artwork to be studied and critiqued.
 
But then, everything had changed.
 
When I moved in with him, a shift occurred. Tiny gestures and hidden moments revealed a different side of him. The way he'd hold the door open for me, the shared meals where he'd ask about my day, the times he'd absentmindedly brush a loose strand of hair away from my face. There was a kindness in him that he hid well, but it was there, simmering beneath the surface. 

And then, he'd shown me his art. His secret sanctuary. A room filled with canvases bearing the imprint of his soul. The raw emotions that bled into each stroke and the love he poured into every detail was breathtaking. He had laid bare his passion before me, shared a part of himself that no one else had been privy to. And that's when I truly saw him for the first time. A man of immense talent, yes, but also a man capable of great love and vulnerability.
 
Slowly, I had fallen in love with this complex, multifaceted man. Not for his art, or his aloofness, or even his kindness. I fell in love with his entirety, his essence. The contradictions that made him, the shades of him that only I got to see.
 
I let my gaze drift away from Luca, focusing on my now-empty cup of tea. I remember the night he shot Bianca. How his face was a mirror of disbelief and horror. He hadn't just killed a woman that night but also a part of himself. The part that believed he was a good man.

In the days following, he had struggled. He had become a shadow of himself, haunted by the ghosts of his past actions. I saw how he looked at himself in the mirror and how his gaze turned inward, punishing. He saw himself as a failure, a man who couldn't protect the woman he loved. His guilt and self-loathing were palpable, the weight of them pressing him down, distorting the man I knew and loved. 

But I never saw him that way. To me, he was a man trying to navigate a world that had been cruelly ripped away from him. A man grappling with an impossible situation, trying to make sense of the chaos that had become his life. I saw his determination, his resilience. The way he kept fighting, kept pushing forward despite the odds. He was not a failure; he was a survivor. A man who, despite the blows life had dealt him, was still standing. He was doing his best, the only way he knew how. And I was determined to stand by him, to fight with him. Because even in his darkest hour, he was still the man I loved and believed in. And I knew, with a certainty that ran deep in my bones, that we could overcome anything together.
 
My heart beats a little faster as Luca drains his cup and sets it down on the ground. The wait has been long and the silence is heavy with anticipation. Luca looks at his watch before meeting my gaze. His eyes, though tired, still hold that spark of determination, that glimmer of hope.
 
"Perhaps he's not coming," I suggest, my voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking any louder might shatter the fragile peace of the evening.
 
"He'll be here," Luca responds.
 
The minutes tick by, each stretching out like an eternity as we wait.
 
The distant rumble of an engine breaks the silence. Luca stiffens, his gaze fixed on the winding lane leading up to our cottage. As a car's headlights begin to slice through the murk. I see a smile form on his face - a mix of relief and triumph.
 
"He's here," Luca announces, his voice barely containing his excitement.
 
The glow of the headlights grows brighter, and I squint against the harsh light, my eyes struggling to make out the vehicle's shape. It's a black Land Rover, powerful and imposing, climbing the hill towards our cottage. Luca's joy turns into worry. His smile fades and his brows furrow as he steps forward, his gaze on the approaching vehicle.
 
"Fuck, he's not alone," he mutters, his voice tight with tension. "This isn't good."

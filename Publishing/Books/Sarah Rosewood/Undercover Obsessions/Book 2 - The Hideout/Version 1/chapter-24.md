A grey world greets me as the cottage door slams behind me; the sky is dark with heavy clouds. The dim light makes it feel like all the colors have been sucked from the world, leaving a dull monochrome. My heart pounds against my chest like a drum, a rhythm of anger and denial. A sudden gust of wind sends a chill down my spine.
 
As I head around the side of the cottage, my eyes scan the weed-infested floor until they fall on what I am seeking. The shovel is caked with dried mud, with rust creeping over its steel blade. My hand reaches out, grasping the rough wooden handle, fingers tracing over old nicks and scratches. A cloud of dust billows up as I slap away the clinging earth, small particles catching in the dying light. I hold the shovel tightly; it's weight is familiar, grounding. For a moment, I stand there, listening to the wind rustling the leaves overhead, the only sound in the otherwise still evening.
 
With shovel in hand, I trudge toward the back of the cottage. There's a small patch of land there, an underutilized corner of the property left to its own devices. It's a wilderness of unruly weeds, tall grasses, and aggressive nettles staking their claim to the neglected earth. Droplets from the recent rain still cling to every leaf and blade of grass, causing the whole area to shimmer in the gloomy twilight. The grass, now heavy with rainwater, squelches under my boots as I navigate the undergrowth. The air feels thick and damp, filled with the musky, earthy scent of decaying vegetation. There's a sense of unease, the feeling that nature has reclaimed this space as its own, rendering it hostile to human intrusion. Tiny creatures that thrive in such damp, hidden places are going about their lives, their constant buzzing and the occasional flash of iridescent wings adding to the air of grim desolation.
 
The light is fading fast, the thick clouds casting long shadows and imbuing everything with foreboding. I brace myself and move into the thicket, the sharp nettles sting my exposed skin. The immediate flush of pain is ignored, my mind preoccupied with the task. 

My eyes dart around the overgrowth until they land on a large rock among the weeds. With a grunt of effort, I roll the stone aside. It's heavier than it looks, its wet surface slippery and cold against my hands. As it moves, revealing the earth hidden beneath it, the sound of shifting stone echoes eerily in the quiet of the encroaching evening. 

Beneath the rock, the grass is sparse, replaced instead by a rich, wet loam teeming with life. Worms wriggle back into the safety of the soil while other insects scuttle away, their tiny homes disturbed. I plunge the shovel into the muddy ground, the squelch of the soil loud in the quiet evening. I dig, my frustration and anger fuelling my movements, each shovelful of earth bringing me closer to the truth, or so I hope. 

I sink the shovel into the wet soil again and again. After half a dozen hefty scoops, my spade strikes something that isn't earth. The sound is different – muffled and hollow.
 
I wipe the sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand and kneel to investigate. There, nestled in the dark soil, is a large blue holdall. Its once vibrant color is smeared with dirt, it's material damp and stained from the soil it's been hiding in. A feeling of dread coils in my gut as I set aside the shovel and start clearing the remaining soil from the bag with my hands. It is cool and squishy, clinging onto the blue fabric of the bag. 

After a few minutes of clawing at the earth, I manage to unearth enough of the bag to haul it out. With a grunt of effort, I yank the heavy holdall out of the hole. The soil underneath gives way easily, and the bag emerges with a soft, sucking sound. I drop it onto the grass beside the hole and sit back on my heels. The bag is covered in dirt, its original color barely visible under the earth stains.
 
I hoist the muddy bag and extract myself from the nettles. I head back around the house, pushing the door open and exploding into the kitchen. Bella hasn't moved an inch, her eyes wide and questioning. I march to the table where our tea cups are still half full. With a sweeping motion, I send the cups crashing to the floor. The porcelain shatters on impact, tea splattering. Bella springs to her feet, and I throw the holdall onto the table with so much force that the entire table shudders. We stare at the filthy blue bag. It's a dirty, ugly stain against the rustic charm of the kitchen.
 
“What are you doing?”
 
I dive into the bag, my fingers connecting with a familiar object enclosed in a protective plastic cover. I take a moment, feeling the adrenaline course through me as the gravity of the situation starts to seep in. I tear the plastic bag open and remove the canvas. It feels lighter than I remember. I straighten up, turning to Bella, my heart pounding against my ribs. Her eyes are wide, a mixture of fear and surprise painting her features. I thrust the canvas into Bella's hands. My unexpected action makes her fumble, nearly dropping the precious cargo. She stabilizes it, her hands trembling slightly, her gaze moving from the tube to me.
 
"Well?" I demand, my voice echoing around the room, too loud in the sudden silence. Bella flinches, taken aback, but doesn't speak. "Fucking show me," I say, my voice grating against the silence. It sounds harsher than I intend, but I can't bring myself to soften it. "Show me how it's a fake." She looks at me, unmoving. "Bella," I demand, a forceful tone slipping into my voice. "Show me, now."
 
She flinches, stepping back from the raw anger radiating off of me. My heart throbs in my chest, and I can almost feel the sharp edge of my patience fraying. The room hangs heavy with tension as Bella nods. With delicate, hesitant movements, she unfurls the painting, the familiar swirls and strokes of colors coming into view. My breath catches as I take in the sight of our ticket to freedom and a life together. She heads over to the draining board, picks up four mugs and returns to the table. She places the cups, one at each corner of the painting.
 
There it is, laid out bare on our kitchen table.
 
My heart clings to that sliver of hope, my mind racing as I look from the painting to Bella, her face pale and eyes filled with uncertainty. This had to be real. It just had to be.
 
The hues and strokes of 'The Poppy Flowers' by Vincent Van Gogh catch the dim light of the kitchen. My heart thumps as I absorb the painting's intricate and distinct details. At the heart of the canvas, a cluster of delicate poppies explodes in vibrant shades of orange, red and yellow, their petals appearing almost translucent under the light, every brushstroke visible. Van Gogh's choice of contrasting the striking poppies against a dark background makes the flowers seem more luminous, more alive. The subtle hints of green in the leaves and stems, the slightly blurred outlines indicate Van Gogh's distinctive style – everything is just as I remember. The use of thick, visible brushstrokes, a technique known as impasto, lends the painting an almost three-dimensional texture. I run my fingers over the ridges and valleys of the paint, imagining Van Gogh's hands guiding the brush over a century ago. The painting emanates a warmth and vitality that contradicts its somber theme of impermanence and death. But then, that's Van Gogh – an artist who found beauty in the mundane and turned it into the extraordinary. My eyes linger over the swirling colors, the gentle roughness of the textures, the masterful blending of light and shadow.

"Show me," I demand, my voice thundering around the small kitchen. "Show me how it's a fake."

She shakes her head. "No."

"Show me," I scream, anger ricocheting off the walls. I see fear flicker in her eyes. It hurts, but I'm past caring.

With a sigh of resignation, she steps towards the table, inviting me to join her. I do, but my eyes never leave her. "Look here,” she says, removing one of the mugs and lifting the corner of the painting to expose the underside. “The canvas, it's wrong." Her finger traces the edge of the painting. "Van Gogh used linen canvas. This...this is inferior. It's actually pretty close. It is from the correct time. Its from a famous canvas dealer in London. Colnaghi, I think he said. Looking closely, you can see the difference in the weave."

I lean in, squinting at the canvas. She's right. It's there. The differences are subtle, but they're there.

“Vincent wouldn’t have used this dealer or this type of canvas.”

“How do we know?” I ask.

“Art historians,” she says with a slight smile.

“Ahh, yeah,” I say. I know she is right.

"And the paint.” She turns the corner back, replacing the mug. She runs her finger over the canvas. “It's synthetic. The real Van Gogh used natural pigments. It’s a good fake. You wouldn't know it unless you knew what to look for, but it's clear. We could have used the paint mixed up from contemporary pigments to Vincent, but it was an unnecessary expense. The painting only had to look real when hanging on the wall; why go to all the extra cost with taxpayer’s money?"

I glance at the strokes of paint, the vibrant orange and yellow. I'd admired the depth of the colors, the vivacity. But now... now, all I see is a lie.

"And Van Gogh's brushstrokes... they were distinctive. Thick, textured, wavy. But these," she points at the lines on the canvas, "they're too smooth. Too uniform. They are good, but not good enough to trick an expert." She steps back and takes in the painting as a whole.

I feel my world crumbling around me. The painting - our salvation, our hope - is a lie. A beautifully crafted, soul-crushing lie.

"Plus, I knew the man who painted it: John Myatt. I met him. He was a charming and talented artist but chose a different path. He’s a famous forger. A good one, the best, but he's gone straight now. We paid him a lot of cash for this fake to look real.”

“But.. but…” I fumble over my words. “We could still sell it. Like you say, it’s a good fake. We might be able to trick someone.”

Bella sighs. “You are right, it could trick someone but its a huge gamble. Anyone looking to spend millions will want this checked and the second a real art expert gets near this with their equipment; it will be clear it's not real.” She looks up at me. “Come on Luca; you know this.”

She's right. I have been in the art game long enough to know that fakes tend to get spotted. I feel the room start to spin. Of course. Of course, it was a fake. The floor tilts beneath my feet. I stand there, staring at the worthless piece of art before me, feeling the anger and disbelief roil inside me. The word ‘no’ rips from my throat, a guttural roar echoing in the stark silence of the kitchen. It vibrates against the stone walls, bouncing back to us, a stark denial of the bitter truth. 

"It can't be fake. It has to be real. It needs to be real." 

My hands curl into tight fists, knuckles blanching white.

Bella stands before me, her delicate face an open canvas of pain and sympathy. Her usually vibrant eyes are now dull and glistening with unshed tears. The silence that follows my outburst is deafening, her silence more eloquent than any words. A tidal wave of resignation crashes over me, pulling me under its oppressive weight. It's over. There's no running now. No sweet dream of escape, of survival. The harsh reality checks me like a slap, the sting lingering. We are stuck, and it's my doing.

I am going to prison, or I will die at Father's hands.

That, I can accept.

But Bella... sweet, innocent Bella will die because of me. Because of my foolish belief, my blind trust. The bitter bile of regret rises in my throat, the metallic taste tainting my tongue.

I've failed. The simple, brutal truth reverberates in my mind, a cacophony of self-loathing and guilt. I thought I was protecting her, saving her, but all I've done is sentence us both to death. My body trembles with the force of my sobs, a physical manifestation of my inner turmoil. My legs buckle, and I crumble onto the cold, unforgiving floor. The harsh reality of our situation saps me of my strength and leaves me hollow and broken. I bury my face in my hands, my sobs echoing through the quiet cottage.

Then, I feel her.

Bella.

She's there, next to me, her arms wrapping around me in a comforting embrace. She doesn't utter a word and offers no platitudes or false hopes. She holds me.

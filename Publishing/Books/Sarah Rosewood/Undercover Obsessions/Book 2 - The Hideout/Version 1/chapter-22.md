## Luca

I gaze up at Bella. 

“Say it, Luca.” Her voice has a sharp tone. Her eyes flash with passion. 

“You are mine,” I say, meaning it. “You belong to me. You are my property.”

As I shift onto my knees, my focus never wavers from Bella. My gaze remains locked onto her, studying her reactions. I bend towards her, the warmth of her skin drawing me in. My lips find the peak of her breast, soft and inviting. The moment I envelop her nipple with my mouth, I hear her sharp intake of breath. The gentle firmness against my tongue, the subtle taste of her skin, and above all, the responsive shiver that runs through her body — it ignites a fire within me. I suck, savoring the moment, feeling her react to every touch, every pull. Her hands find my hair, fingers threading through the strands, guiding, urging.  

I pull away and our eyes meet. “That nipple is mine, it belongs to me; it is my property.”
My fingers trace a path along the smooth curve of her hip, the subtle dip of her waist, until they venture between her thighs. I let my fingers brush her pussy lips. I push into her, letting her wetness cover my fingertips. A soft moan escapes her lips, her body leaning into my hand, urging me to explore further. The moisture, the softness, the way her body contracts and releases subtly with every movement of my fingers.
With my fingers still inside her, I lean in, my lips brushing her ear. “This pussy is mine,” I say. “It belongs to me; it is my property.”

I remove my fingers from inside her. She allows a small gasp to escape. I move my fingers from between her legs to her mouth. I am slow, allowing her to see the movement. I place my wet fingers on her lips. I can feel the gentle parting of her lips, the moist warmth of her breath ghosting over my fingertips. She glances up, her eyes heavy with passion, and there's a silent plea there, a hunger I've come to know well. Bella's tongue ventures out, tasting herself on my fingers. 

“These lips are mine,” I say. “They belongs to me; they are my property.”

I remove my fingers, looking her in the eyes. 

I guide her backward onto the soft expanse of the bed. As she falls, a cascade of hair spills around her face, creating a dark halo contrasting with the white sheets. Her eyes remain locked onto mine, trusting and inviting. I'm aware of Bella's gaze on me, the intensity of her eyes both thrilling and nerve-wracking. It's a vulnerability that's rarely seen from me, but with her, everything's different.

I hook my fingers over my boxers and pull them down. I am hard, my cock erect. I see Bella look at it, and I smile. I know she wants me. I know she wants my cock inside her. I move to between her legs, I can feel the warmth radiating from her, drawing me closer. Her eyes never leave mine, a clear invitation and trust reflected in them. She shifts slightly, making room for me.

“You are mine,” I say. “You belong to me; you are my property.” 

I move my body and position my cock so it rests close to her pussy. I see Bella’s eyes on my body. Her breath is slow and controlled she is waiting. I allow the tip of my cock to touch her pussy lips. She opens her legs, inviting me. I smile.

“My baboon is always a little slut for me.”

She opens her mouth to reply but I slip my cock inside her. I am slow. I let the tip push into her. The wetness pulls me in. She gasps. I slide it deeper, allowing the warmth of her pussy to engulf me. 

“Luca,” she says. “I need you.”

I am gentle. I allow my cock to build a slow rhythm, matching the movement of her body. I allow her to dictate the pace. It is slow, the passion building. I bend down and kiss her lips. I allow my cock to penetrate her while my lips meet her neck, kissing her skin. I nibble at her, and she lets out another gasp.

I feel the pace quicken. The pleasure is rising in her. I can feel the tension building in her. The pleasure is flooding my body. I need to cum. I need to fill her. 

I quicken the pace, forcing her to react. I push deeper; each thrust brings a small gasp from her.   

I feel her body tense. Her hands reach around my back, her fingers digging into my skin. 

“I am going to cum,” she says, her words forced out. 

She stops moving, the tension filling her. She cums, her orgasm being released in a single breath. I follow her body. My cock aches and then spurts. I let out a long moan as my seed fills her. 

I hold her as we both orgasm. Our breathing synchronizes, and our bodies feel as one. 
I let her finish. 

The heat and urgency of the moment begin to ebb, replaced by a gentle, lingering warmth. I shift off Bella, feeling the cool air contrast against the parts of my body that had been pressed so closely to hers. Our skin is slick with a thin sheen of sweat.

We turn towards each other. Laying side by side, I wrap my arm around her waist, pulling her close. Our bodies fit together perfectly, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle finding their match. Her head nestles in the crook of my neck, and I can feel the gentle rise and fall of her chest against mine. We share slow, tender kisses. My fingers trace lazy patterns on her back, and I feel her sigh against my skin.

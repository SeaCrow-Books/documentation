## Luca

My hands move in the soapy cold water, scrubbing away at the remnants of our meal. The rhythmic sound of the scrubbing brushes against the silence of the farmhouse, the only noise apart from my breathing. Bella is sitting at the kitchen table, a worn novel in her hands. I fish out a large knife from the depths of the sink, grabbing the handle. 

The tranquility is punctured by the murmur of voices from outside. 

The sound is faint but unmistakable against the quiet backdrop. I freeze, the soapy dish in my hand forgotten, my heart pounding. For a moment, I convince myself that it's just the wind playing tricks on my already stressed mind. But then it becomes louder. There are people outside.

My eyes flick to Bella. She is sitting motionless, a look of fear on her face. I look to the window, peering into the evening light, straining to catch a glimpse of our unexpected visitors. My hands are clenched around the edges of the sink, the cold porcelain biting into my skin. I take a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. 

Bella's soft footsteps echo in the room's hush as she moves towards the window. The soft rustling of her clothes is the only sound that follows her, an intimate whisper against the underlying silence. With a grace that always catches me off-guard, she pushes aside the lace curtain, peering into the encroaching twilight. I watch her, the anxiety in my chest easing a fraction at her composed demeanor. Her body relaxes visibly and she exhales, a sigh of relief escaping her lips.

"It's just walkers," she murmurs, her voice a soothing balm to my frayed nerves.

Outside, the voices are louder, resonating with cheerful banter and light-hearted laughter. Bella turns to look at me, her face illuminated by the soft glow from the window. Her eyes, pools of warmth in the fading light, hold an understanding that eases the knot of fear in my gut. For a moment, we stand there, caught in a bubble of shared relief, the world outside fading into a distant hum.

A sudden surge of anger and fear ripples through me, irrational but overwhelming. My hands clench, my fingers closing around the handle of the knife I'd been washing. It's cold, solid - a weighty reassurance in my grasp. Ignoring Bella's startled gasp, I charge out of the house, my bare feet pounding on the worn garden path. The knife gleams in the weak sunlight,.

Two walkers - a man and a woman, both around sixty - stand a few meters away. They're garbed in typical outdoor gear, their faces flushed from the exercise. They look innocent, completely out of place in my fear-charged reality.

But I can't take chances, not anymore.

"This is private property," I bark out. “Fuck off.” 

Their eyes wide, they stumble back, their faces morphing into masks of confusion and fear. “This… this is a public path,” the man stammers. He holds up a folded Ordnance Survey map.

“I don’t give a fuck what your map says; this is private property. Now fuck off.” I lift the knife, the rays from the low sun glinting on its blade.

They look at each other and back at me, and in that moment, I see a primal instinct take over; they assess the situation, the choice simple - fight or flight. They choose flight. Not a difficult choice. They turn and bolt, their hasty retreat punctuated by terrified gasps and leaves rustling underfoot. For a few heartbeats, I stand there, my chest heaving, the icy grip of the knife still firm in my hand. The adrenaline rush recedes, leaving me drained and hollow. I lower my hand, the knife now feeling heavy and alien. 

I trudge back to the house. 

"Bella," I start, my voice hoarse with a fear I'm struggling to contain, "we're in danger."

She's standing by the window, the afternoon light casting her in a soft halo, highlighting the worry etched onto her face. But it's not just worry I see in her eyes, but something far worse - terror. 

"Luca," she says, her voice a steady whisper, "you're scaring me."

I can't meet her eyes, not when they're filled with fear and doubt. I swallow hard, forcing myself to regain control. 

"I'm sorry," I murmur, my gaze fixed on the aged wooden floor. "I'm going to fix this, Bella."

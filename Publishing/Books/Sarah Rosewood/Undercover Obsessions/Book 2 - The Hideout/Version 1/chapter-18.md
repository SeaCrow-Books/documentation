I shudder as the cool air seeps through my thin shirt. For a moment, I stand on the path, scanning the expanse of the landscape stretching out before me. There's a stillness in the air, a silence that seems to echo the uneasy churn in my gut. I tip my head back, squinting at the sky. The brilliant, vast expanse of clear blue has vanished, replaced by an ominous stretch of slate-gray. The once fluffy, white clouds have darkened, rolling together to form an intimidating, undulating blanket. A storm is brewing. The smell of it - damp, earthy, and filled with portentous electricity - fills my nostrils. There's a low grumble in the distance, like a giant clearing its throat. The promise of a downpour is in the air, the landscape hushed in expectant anticipation. The wind picks up, sweeping over the rolling hills and carrying the chill of the impending storm. It tugs at my clothes, flapping the hem of my coat as if urging me to move, to find shelter.
 
Pulling my coat tighter around me, the cold steel of the gun pressing reassuringly against my side, I take a deep breath. A flicker of movement catches my eye, a break in the otherwise still tableau of the surrounding landscape. Down the lane, a figure emerges, dressed in the garb of a hiker, his backpack bobbing with each step. My heart hammers in my chest, adrenaline flooding my system. I bolt towards the gate. I push the gate open, the bell trap jingles, a discordant chime that shatters the looming silence. The hiker doesn't seem to hear it; his back turned to me as he continues down the lane.
 
"Hey," I shout.  

The hiker turns, and his eyes lock with mine for a split second. I break into a sprint. Heâ€™s spinning away from me, his strides long and quick. I push harder, trying to keep up, but the man is fast. He's better prepared and dressed in proper hiking gear, giving him an advantage on the rugged terrain. My boots slip and a sharp stitch develops in my side. Despite the pain, I force myself to keep going, pumping my arms and legs as hard as possible. The gap between us widens. The hiker's speed is just too much. He's getting away. My chest heaves as I try to suck in more air. Frustration boils up inside me. The hiker disappears around a bend, and I can't keep up despite my best efforts. I skid to a stop, panting and cursing under my breath. I look back at the cottage, a speck in the distance now, and feel a deep dread settling in.
 
I try to gather my thoughts. If he's an innocent hiker, I've just given the poor guy the fright of his life. But if he's a pro he'll have thought this through and planned for every eventuality, including being chased. If that's the case, there's no point in going after him - he's probably halfway to who-knows-where by now.
 
The walk back to the cottage is more of a slog than I remember. The adrenaline has faded, leaving only fatigue and worry in its wake. As I crest the last hill, the cottage comes into view. From here, it seems peaceful, undisturbed, a cozy little refuge nestled among the Welsh hills. But I know better. It's not the safe haven it once was. My pace quickens, despite the fatigue.
 
I step into the cottage, the unsettling silence hitting me. My eyes dart around, but there's no sign of Bella. A cold shiver of panic trickles down my spine.
 
"Bella," I call out, my voice echoing through the unnerving stillness. My heart hammers as I stand frozen, straining to hear any sign of her. Then, faint and muffled, I catch the distinctive sound of her sobbing. "Bella," I call again, this time my voice choked with desperation.
 
I follow the trail of her sobs. I find her in the bedroom, huddled under the covers. The sight of her like this, so vulnerable and scared, twists something deep within me. In two strides, I'm by her side, sinking to my knees on the worn carpet. I hesitate, then stroke her hair, trying to offer some semblance of comfort amidst the turmoil.
 
"Hey," I whisper, my voice barely more than a breath, "I'm here, Bella. You're not alone."
 
I slip into the bed beside her, the worn springs creaking under my weight. Pulling her into my arms, I wrap them around her shaking body. I can feel her heart pounding against her rib cage, mirroring the frantic beat of my own.
 
"It's okay. It's going to be okay," I murmur into her hair, my words tumbling out in a desperate attempt to soothe her. I tighten my grip around her, trying to shield her from the world outside. The taste of fear is bitter in my mouth, a potent reminder of the danger we're in. I swallow it down, pushing aside my worries to focus on Bella. "You're safe, Bella," I whisper, my voice barely above a tremor. "I'm here and won't let anything happen to you."

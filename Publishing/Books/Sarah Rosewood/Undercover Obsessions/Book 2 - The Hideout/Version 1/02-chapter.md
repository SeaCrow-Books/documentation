# Chapter 2
## Luca

I stand looking out over the valley. Before me, a tableau of wild beauty stretches into the distance. Sunlight filters through the dense clusters of woodland. A crystal-clear stream meanders at the edge of my vision. Silhouetted peaks rise in the distance, their summits bathed in the gentle blush of the retreating sun. The profound stillness resonates within me. This remoteness is our sanctuary, a refuge from the world we left behind. Behind me, the sun dips below the hills. The fading light drapes the valley in spectral shadows, casting an ethereal quality over the scene. As dusk descends, a gentle rain begins to fall. 

I gather up my painting equipment. I step into the kitchen with my art supplies tucked under my arm. The scene is a comforting tableau of domesticity. Bella's here, her back to me. She has her hands in the sink, washing the dishes. The generator's humming fills the cottage, blending with the muffled patter of rain against the window panes. She's wearing a faded denim skirt, and a loose, cotton shirt rolled up to her elbows. Her hair, usually flowing free, is tied up into a bun, loose strands escaping here and there to frame her face. She looks like an angel in the warm glow of her candles. Instead of diminishing her beauty, smears of dirt on her cheek add an endearing charm that makes my heart race.

I feel my cock twitch. There’s something about the mundanity of her that I find attractive. This beautiful creature, hidden away for my pleasure.

The small room was bare and uninviting when we arrived but it has been transformed by Bella. There's a sense of homeliness that has seeped into the very fabric of the place. Old trinkets we've collected from nearby towns now adorn the shelves. The worn wooden table is a centerpiece laden with freshly baked bread and a steaming tea pot. The flickering candlelight casts dancing shadows on the stone walls, adding a cozy, intimate aura to our secluded sanctuary.

I drop my stuff near the entrance. Bella turns her head and our eyes meet. A blush rises as she brushes the stray hair strands from her face. Her eyes, twinkling in the candlelight, meet mine, and her lips curve into a radiant smile. In this soft, warm glow, I see not just the woman I love but also a life brimming with tranquility and joy. My heart throbs in my chest.

She turns back. “You ok?” she asks over her shoulder.

I approach her, wrapping my arms around her waist from behind. I hug her tight into me, feeling her soft body against mine. She lets out a low whimper of pleasure. I lean forward, my weight pushing her against the sink. She lets out a breath as the wind is pushed out of her. I see the soft nape of her neck, her exposed skin a soft pink in the muffled light of the cottage. I lean forward, my lips touching the skin of her neck. I feather her neck with light kisses. I hear her moan, a low animal-like acceptance of pleasure. She pushes her arse back against my hard cock. She is aware that this will drive me mad, but she’s playing with fire. She does this, tests me. I allow my tongue to touch the skin of her neck. I am soft, the tip tracing a line on her skin. I can see the goosebumps form and the soft hair prickle under the touch. She tries to pull away, but I hold her in place.

“That’s nice,” she says.

I breathe in, holding her for a moment before nibbling at the skin. I am soft. I want her to feel a mix of sensations. It is just at the side of her neck. I know this is an especially sensitive area for her. She giggles and tries to pull away before realizing I have control and submitting to the idea that she is trapped. She feels small under my grasp and the weight of my body. I bite down a little harder, my teeth squeezing into her skin. She moans. I can’t see, but I know she has her eyes closed. I bite harder, increasing the pressure. She sucks in her breath against the pain. I bite as hard as I dare, I don’t want to break the skin but I want to mark her. I suck at the skin. I know this will hurt; the pain will be shooting through her. She would pull away if I was not pinning her. She knows better than to cry out, she knows to take it. I pull away.

“Good girl.” 

I don’t use the phrase without a cause; she must earn it. Its a gift.

I look at my work. The stark red lines of my teeth ring an angry mark on her neck. I know that the bruise will grow and darken over the next few hours. If I am lucky, flecks of yellow will form as it heals. A brand. A mark that she is my property.

I pull away and release my arms. I step back. Her back is still facing me, and her hands are on the side of the sink. She still has her arse pushed backwards towards me. I allow my eyes to follow the curve of her body. I start at the ankles, my eyes tracing the shape of her bare legs to the short shirt. She is pushing her arse out towards me, begging for me, tightening the fabric across her perfectly formed cheeks.

“I need my pussy,” I say. I hear a low moan of satisfaction at my words.

I move forward a little and grab the hem of her skirt. I yank it upwards. She is wearing dark navy knickers. They have ridden up a little, highlighting the curve of her arse cheeks. She starts to turn back towards me.

“Stay the fuck there,” I say. My voice is a growl. “Keep that arse exposed for me.”

“Yes sir,” she says, recovering the position.

She is a good girl. She has taken her training well over the past few weeks.

I move my hand to the zip of my trousers and pull it down. I push my hand into the fabric and release my cock. I am hard. That is an understatement. My cock is like a fucking rock. The image of this beautiful creature, her arse exposed, legs slightly apart, waiting for me is intense.

I let my fingers touch the edge of her panties, where the cheeks of her arse are stretching the material. I pull the knickers to the side. I move forward with one hand on my stiff shaft and the other holding the material. I allow the tip of my cock to find the gap between her cheeks. For a moment, I push against her arse hole. Not too hard, but enough pressure to force out a small squeak. I enjoy the feeling of power. I know she will be wondering if I am about to penetrate her hole. It would not be the first time I have used all of her holes. The feeling of my cum leaking from her abused arse is not a new feeling for her. But, today, I want her pussy.

I adjust my stance and guide my cock between her legs. For a moment, there’s resistance. Then her wetness soaks onto her lips, sucking in my hungry cock. I am inside her in an instant. She gasps. I thrust hard into her, pinning her against the sink, my cock plunging deep. She shifts her weight as she is pinned.

“You fucking like that, don’t you?”

I hear her pull in a breath. “Yes, sir,” she says.

I thrust into her again; she lets out a small moan as I thrust as deep as I can manage. I am large but she is taking all of me.

“You are a fucking whore.”

“I am,” she says. “I don’t deserve your hard cock. You are kind for letting me feel you.” I love that she knows what to say, what will excite me. “Please let me have your cum.” Her words are said in a soft voice, almost a whisper. “Please, sir, I need it.”

I thrust again. I feel my climax rising to a point I can no longer control. I grab her hips and pull her onto my cock. She moves a little, trying to keep her balance as I use her. I have no regard for this; she must be there for me. I feel her wetness, the juices coating my cock and balls. I slide out of her and back in. I am deep again. I stop moving as the sensation builds, my cock buried in her pussy. My cum squirts. I think of the hot white liquid pumping into her. I let out a long, uncontrolled moan. My eyes are closed as I fill her. When I have finished, I pull out of her. My cock is slick with my cum and her juices. I push it back into my trousers.

I look up to see her start to move.

“Where the fuck are you going?” I ask.

She turns her head to look at me. I see confusion flash across her face. “I… I need to clean up.”

“What? You want to waste my cum?” She makes eye contact. Her eyes sparkle in the light.

“No, sorry, sir. I am lucky to have your cum inside me.”

I reach down and adjust her knickers and pull down her skirt. “Since you have been such a good girl you get to feel my cum for the rest of the day. It will remind you that you belong to me. Understand?”

I am sure I see a smile flash across her lips. “Yes, sir. Thank you.”

I take her by the hand, turning her away from the sink. She allows me to lead her to the bedroom. We climb onto the bed. The scent of our shared intimacy lingers in the air, mingling with the fresh smell of the rain outside. I lie on my back, the worn-out quilt beneath me, Bella nestled in the crook of my arm. Our bodies are entwined, a comfortable closeness beyond the physical. A soft sigh escapes her as she buries her head in my chest, and I tighten my grip around her. Her skin is warm to the touch, still flushed from our love-making. As I stroke her hair, my mind begins to wander. I gaze up at the bare wooden beams of our cottage, the flickering candlelight casting an inviting glow around the room. It's tranquil. I close my eyes, taking in the rhythm of Bella's soft breathing and the familiar hum of the generator outside, the very essence of our secluded world. In the quiet solitude of these valleys, I've found my haven. My escape. The perfect place to lose myself in my painting, surrounded by breathtaking landscapes and the woman I love. 

I brush a lock of hair away from her face, my fingers tracing the curve of her cheek. I glance at the small, dirty, window in the bedroom, the rain patterning against the glass. I feel something. A flicking emotion... hope. The longer we can stay hidden, the safer we'll be. And once the dust has settled, we can make a break for it.

"France," I find myself whispering to Bella, my voice barely audible over the soft thrum of the rain outside. "The South of France. We could find a small house, blend in, start fresh." I can see it so vividly in my mind's eye. A quaint little cottage, much like the one we're in now, but nestled amidst rolling vineyards, with the warm sun beating down on us. She turns to look at me, her eyes glinting in the candlelight. I can see the questions in her gaze, the flicker of hope mixed with uncertainty. "And raise a family," I add, the words tumbling out before I can stop them.

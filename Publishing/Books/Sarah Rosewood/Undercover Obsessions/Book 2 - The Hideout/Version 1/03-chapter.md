# Chapter 3
## Bella

The comforting warmth of Luca's hand in mine is my anchor in the sprawling wilderness. Breathing in deeply, the crisp air fills my lungs, a mixture of damp earth and blooming life that only the countryside can offer. The landscape around us is a patchwork of rolling hills and fields of vibrant green, punctuated by the occasional outcrop of towering oaks; among them, scattered wildflowers add splashes of color. Evidence of the rain of the previous days is no where to be seen, instead, the sky is a breathtaking infinite blue, unmarred by a single wisp of cloud. There are no other human souls around. We are alone. In this verdant expanse of the countryside, it's just Luca and me, two beings lost to the world. Here, we are not fugitives, not outcasts. Here, we are just two lovers, walking side by side, enveloped in our secret sanctuary, untouched and untainted by the chaos of the outside world.

My thoughts drift to the man standing next to me. Luca. There's a kindness in his eyes, a gentle strength that's been my anchor amidst stormy seas. As his fingers tighten around mine, I am once again reminded of why I have chosen this path, why I have chosen him. I recall our conversation from the previous night, his words floating back to me amidst the whispers of the wind. France. The thought brings a soft smile to my lips, a hopeful flicker in my chest. I can see us, nestled within a quaint little house, stone walls kissed by the warmth of the southern sun. I open my eyes, the vision still vivid in my mind. The dream feels tangible, within our reach.Luca squeezes my hand as though he could sense the shift in my thoughts. 

I turn to him, the sun casting a golden halo around his figure. "Last night,” I say. He looks at me. “What you said about escaping. Do you think we could really do it? Live in France... be safe... have a family?" 

His eyes meet mine, steady and resolute. He smiles and gives the slightest of nods. No words are needed. 

We come to a break in the nearby hedge. There is a gate but it is old, no longer active as a barrier. Luca stops and glances at the gate. 

"Follow me," he says. 

He moves toward the gate, climbing over and into the field. I follow. 

"Where are we going?" I ask.

Luca shrugs and laughs. "Let's explore. I think I saw something." As Luca and I traverse the idyllic landscape, our attention is caught by a peculiar sight. "There," he says, pointing.  

Partly veiled by clusters of gorse and heather, an unassuming shepherd's hut stands like a forgotten sentinel. It is old and has been crafted from chunks of locally quarried stone. Its roof, formed from timbers, now weathered to a soft grey, bears the scars of many a storm, yet still offers a shelter against the capricious Welsh climate. Wounded and weathered by countless decades of harsh winds and relentless rains, the hut exists in a state of dignified disrepair. Moss and lichen have claimed the once robust walls, their vibrant hues set against the muted stones, a living testament of nature reclaiming its own. Some stones, surrendered to the erosion of time and weather, lay scattered around, forming an irregular patchwork. Despite its slightly sagging wooden roof, the hut's inherent resilience, which reflects the spirit of the land it inhabits, holds firm.

We stomp through the long grass to the hut's door. From the outside, the interior is dark; the contrast with the sunlight is too great to see inside, but as we get closer, my eyes adjust. 

"I have a surprise," Luca says. 

He reaches into his backpack, extracting a bottle of wine with a flourish that suggests a well-guarded secret. With it, he produces a pair of small chipped mugs he must have taken from the kitchen. He uncorks the wine, and the air fills with the matured grapes' rich, heady scent. Luca pours the deep red liquid, and the tiny space feels imbued with an intimacy that makes my heart flutter. His gaze finds mine as he hands me my cup. The spark between us is almost palpable. I accept the cup, fingers grazing and a warmth spreads through me, making the shepherd's hut feel like the most romantic spot in the world.

The sun cast a gentle glow over the vast meadow, the world around me seemingly painted in hues of gold and emerald. Luca takes my hand and we leave the hut, finding a spot just outside. He crouches down and sits on the grass. I follow. We sit in silence for a few minutes. Luca repositions himself, lowering himself into the soft grass. I smile and join him. Luca and I lay side by side in the soft grass, the earth beneath us warm and welcoming. 

Turning my head to the side, my gaze meets Luca's profile. His eyelashes, dark and thick, cast tiny shadows over his high cheekbones, which are kissed by the sun. The gentle curve of his lips, slightly parted, holds a promise of unspoken words and secrets. Each detail of his face, from the small scar above his eyebrow to the way his hair tumbles effortlessly over his forehead, draws me in like a moth to a flame. Something about this moment, the raw vulnerability in his eyes and the tranquility surrounding us, strikes a chord deep within me. My heart begins to race, its rhythm mirroring the ebb and flow of the emotions swelling inside. My breath catches, the weight of the realization pressing down on me: I am irrevocably drawn to him. The space between us seems to diminish, as if some magnetic force pulls at my very core. Without realizing it, my body moves of its own accord, inching closer until our faces are just a breath apart. Every fiber of my being screams for connection, the intimacy of a touch, the melding of two souls. Overwhelmed by the intensity of my feelings and the close proximity, I press my lips onto his. The world fades away, and there is only us in that moment. The kiss is a confession, affirmation, and surrender to the undeniable pull between us.

The moment our lips touch, there's a gentle hesitance, a tentative exploration as if we're both entering unfamiliar territory. But that initial softness quickly deepens into something more intense, a yearning that's been lurking just beneath the surface.

Luca reacts, his lips pressing to mine. Every restraint we once had seems to melt away, replaced by raw, insatiable passion. His hands cradle my face, fingers weaving through my hair, pulling me closer to him. I feel the heat from his body, the solid contours of his muscles, and the rapid thrumming of his heart against my chest. A surge of electricity pulses through me. The sensation of his mouth, the taste of him, is heady and intoxicating. My senses are overwhelmed. The scent of his skin heightens everything, the rhythm of our breaths mingling, the gentle caress of his fingers on my back.

I feel cherished and desired. It's as if we're trying to say every unsaid word and express every pent-up emotion through this one kiss. A yearning to truly understand and be understood.

I feel Luca’s hand move and rest on my thigh. A tingle of anticipation washes through me. His hand moves up my leg, his fingers soft but urgent. For a moment, I want him to take me. I want him to rip at my clothes, expose me to the sun, and make love to me here in view of the world. I breathe through the kiss. His hand travels up my body and rests on my breasts. He is soft at first, searching for my nipple over the fabric. I can feel the urgency rising in him. He grabs at me his strong fingers pulling at the material of my clothes, squeezing my breasts. I feel the passion rising in both of us.

Usually, it's Luca who leads our sex, his confidence and charisma guiding us. But something shifts inside me. An urge, a desire to take the reins, bubbles up from a place I hadn't acknowledged before. It's an ember that's been slowly kindling, and now, at this moment, it sparks into a flame.

I break our kiss and look into his eyes. He smiles.

“I love you,” I say.

“I love you too.”

“Now, on your back,” I say with a wide smile.

He hesitates for a moment, an emotion flashes across his eyes. What is that? Confusion? Fear? It is gone. 

“Ohh, I like dominant Bella,” he says. 

He moves so he is on his back, looking up at me. I roll over, pinning him beneath me. A flicker of surprise lights up his eyes, but a mischievous glint, a silent encouragement, quickly replaces it. Heart pounding, I take control. There's something incredibly exhilarating about this change, about being the one who dictates the pace and the depth of our connection. But even as I lead, I feel that we have a shared understanding. A mutual respect and a mutual desire.

I am straddling Luca, one knee either side of his waist. I lift my weight and shuffle down his body. I allow my legs and crotch to brush his already hard penis. Though it's caged behind the material of his trousers, I can still feel that he is excited. I lift myself off his body and lay next to him. My head inches from his hidden cock. I lift my weight onto one shoulder and unzip his trousers. I don’t wait for permission and instead, push my hand into the gap and pull out his cock. I let it rest a moment, looking at it hardness. The end glistens with pre-cum in the sun. I feel a slight breeze wash over us, and for a moment, I am aware we are in the open, exposed in a field.

I lean over and take his cock in my mouth.

The sensation of having Luca at my mercy is heady, intoxicating. Every touch, every move I make, draws reactions from him that I'd never seen before. The usually confident, in-control man is now under my spell, and the power of it is overwhelming. I navigate every inch of his cock, drawing forth moans and gasps that only drive my confidence higher. It's a dance, an intimate play of give and take, and in this moment, I'm leading. I let my tongue trace circles on the tip of his cock, before plunging it deep into my mouth, almost gagging on the size. Hearing him, feeling him writhe beneath me, only intensifies my arousal. The knowledge that I can elicit such raw, unabashed pleasure from him is a revelation. Each of his reactions, every shiver, every whimper, is a testament to our deep connection. There's a vulnerability in this, in witnessing Luca laid bare. It's beautiful and raw, deepening my feelings of connection and desire. 

I focus entirely on his cock and give him as much pleasure as possible, guided by his reactions, letting his sounds and movements be my roadmap. The intensity of the moment is palpable, and as Luca reaches the height of his pleasure, I can't help but feel a profound sense of satisfaction, knowing that I have played a part in this shared euphoria. It's an experience, a bond, that words could never truly capture.

I pull away. He looks up at me, his eyes pleading.

“You cum when I say.” I keep eye contact, my words firm. He nods his head. He is aware of the rules. 

I stand, leaving Luca prone on the floor. I see his eyes following me. I lift my eyes, letting them sweep over the sprawling expanse before me. The Welsh fields stretch endlessly, a tapestry of deep greens and muted browns, bathed in the soft golden light of the setting sun. The long grasses sway, caressed by the breeze.

I bend to remove my shoes, placing them to the side. There's a ritualistic nature to the way I unfasten my trousers, letting them slide down my legs and gather around my ankles. Every movement is unhurried, deliberate. The air is cool on my exposed skin, sending a light shiver up my spine, but I revel in it. The wind toys with the hem of my clothes, letting the fabric brush against the top of my thighs. Looking down, I see Luca — his face a mix of awe, anticipation, and sheer desire. It's intoxicating, this power I hold over him, and it thrums through me, mingling with my own burgeoning arousal. The energy between us is almost palpable, like a living thing. His gaze, heavy-lidded yet sharp, follows my every move, taking in the curve of my hips and my thighs' softness. I've seen that look before, but this feels different — there's an intensity, a rawness that's heightened by our surroundings.

"Enjoying the view?" I ask drawing a deep breath.

His response is almost immediate, the rough timbre of his voice sending another shiver through me. "More than you know."

I step forward, placing one foot on either side of his hips. I see his eyes follow the curves of my legs to my knickers. I move my hands so they are touching the fabric between my legs.

“Do you want to see?” I say.

“Yes.” His voice is little more than a hoarse whisper.

I pull the fabric to the side, exposing my pussy. It has been hard to shave and I know that my lips are framed by soft brown hair, a little more than stubble. He gasps. While holding the material to one side and holding eye contact, I run my hand along my now wet pussy lips. I push two fingers inside. I see him look. I move my fingers, stroking myself. When I know they are wet and remove them. I let his eyes meet mine. I lift the fingers to my mouth and let my tongue taste the wetness. I push my fingers into my mouth, covering them like I had covered his cock moments before.

The sensation of power courses through me. With every deliberate move I make, every teasing glance I throw his way, I see his responses — the eager anticipation in his eyes, the way his breath catches, the palpable tension in his body. This isn't a feeling I've often allowed myself with Luca. Our dynamic has always been complex, a dance of wills and wants. But right now, the balance of power is tipped in my favor, and it's intoxicating. There's a heady thrill in having someone like Luca, so often the dominant force, so visibly affected by my actions. It’s more than just a physical allure; it's a deep-seated need to exert control, to show him — and perhaps myself — that I'm not just a passive participant in our relationship.

Every time he looks at me, I feel a surge of confidence. The way his eyes linger on me, hungry and pleading, only makes me feel more in command. The world around us fades, the vastness of the fields, the distant hills, everything becomes a blur, with only the two of us in sharp focus.

“Do you want to feel my pussy on your cock?” I ask.

He is slow to answer as if there’s an internal battle. “Yes, Baboon.”

“That’s not my name. Answer correctly.”

He smiles. “Yes… Bella.”

I squat, lowering myself toward his body. I take his cock in my hand and guide it toward my pussy, allowing the tip to enter. I shift my weight, move my hand to his chest and allow his cock inside me.

He gasps. “Fuck.”

I lean back, straddling him. I am kneeling now, my knees in the soft grass, his body between my legs. I have never ridden him like this before and by the look on his face, he is enjoying the experience. I rock, feeling his cock inside me. I move so the tips brush my G spot. A shock of pleasure spikes through me. I move again, forcing his cock to rub me. Another wave of pleasure. I move faster, my hips establish a steady rhythm. Each time I rock, an increasingly pleasurable wave of sensation washes over me.

I look down at him; his eyes are closed.

“Luca,” I say. His eyes flick open. “Don’t cum. Understand?”

“Yes.”

I shift my weight, sitting upright with my hand behind me on his thighs. I grind against his cock. Luca moves with my movement, pushing upwards into me. I move slowly at first. I close my eyes as I feel the pressure build in my pelvis. Each time I move, it builds, sensations washing over me. I hear a gasp escape my lips. I move faster, all thoughts of nothing but this moment of pleasure. The rhythm is steady; I am almost bouncing on his cock. I am panting a heavy breath, and a small squeak escapes with each thrust of his cock. I feel my body tense. I move my hips as if I am trying to consume his hard cock. Faster. Grinding into him.

I cum.

A loud squeal escapes my lips and echoes across the surrounding countryside.

I stop moving and pause. I can feel the remnants of my orgasm filtering through my body. I can also feel Luca’s hard cock throbbing inside me. It is almost like I had forgotten about him. I was using his erection for my own pleasure. I look down and smile. I am a little embarrassed but this disappears when I see his eyes. They are full of lust and love. He wants me.

I pull myself from his hard cock and kneel beside him. I smile and look at him. “Your turn.” I bend down and take his cock in my mouth. It is different this time. I can taste myself on him; my juices have soaked his shaft and leaked down into the soft, black pubic hair. I engulf his cock with my mouth. I move my head up and down, feeling it slip into my mouth and throat. I pull my head away, still holding his cock in my hand.

“Cum for me,” I say.

I let my lips kiss the tip of his cock, tasting his salty pre-cum. I glance up to see his eyes are closed. I smile and take of his cock one more time. I allow my mouth to cover the length. I move my head in a steady motion, while rubbing the shaft with my hands. I feel his hips move and Luca lets out a low moan. I focus on keeping a steady rhythm and giving him the most pleasure. He lets out another low moan, and I speed up, my mouth engulfing his cock.

“I am going to cum,” he says.

I feel him tense and a sudden flow of warm sperm fills my mouth. I relax, allowing it to fill me before swallowing his seed. His cum continues to pump out, and I suck up every drop. I am hungry for him. I wait until I am sure he is finished. I move my head from his cock and smile. I think about calling him ‘good boy’, but I feel that the time isn't right, and Luca’s dominance will not take the challenge. I smile.

I recover my clothes, pulling on my trousers and shoes. Luca and I sprawl out, our bare skin prickling with the light kiss of the cool breeze. I allow my eyes to close as I enjoy the peace.

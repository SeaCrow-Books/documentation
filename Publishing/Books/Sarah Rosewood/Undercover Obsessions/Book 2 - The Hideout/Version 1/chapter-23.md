## Bella
 
We're sitting at the old wooden kitchen table, the steam from our mugs of tea rising in the dim morning light. Outside, the rain has finally let up. Across from me, Luca is deep in thought. I watch him as he stirs his tea, his mind elsewhere. I take in the sight of him, his tousled hair, and the way the soft morning light falls on his robust features. He looks up and our eyes meet. For a moment, we're just two people at a kitchen table, sharing a quiet morning. 

A wave of affection sweeps over me, so strong it takes my breath away. His eyes look tired, the usual spark dimmed by the weight of our situation. Yet, despite everything, he's never looked more attractive to me. The lines on his face, the intensity of his gaze, the stubborn set of his jaw. Each detail and imperfection combines to paint a picture of the man I love. I reach out and touch his hand. His eyes flicker to mine, his expression softening. I squeeze his hand, trying to communicate without words. Trying to tell him that whatever is coming, we'll face it together. He gives me a small smile and squeezes my hand back. The look in his eyes, determination and resolve, sparks something in me. I feel a rush of love for him, a love that's become more than an emotion. It fills me with warmth, not only in my chest but in my whole body.
 
A realization hits me like a punch to the gut, a sudden clarity that puts our situation's gravity into focus. Luca is planning on risking everything, his life, his freedom, on a painting that isn't real. Until now, it had been easy to keep quiet. The danger had been distant and unreal, and the deception had felt harmless.
 
But now... now it's different.
 
The danger is here, real and palpable, no longer just a theoretical threat lurking in the shadows. And Luca is ready to walk right into it, all for a lie. A lie that I have perpetuated. A cold feeling of dread seeps into me. How did I let it come to this? Why did I keep quiet? Was I protecting myself or simply too cowardly to face the truth?
 
I look at Luca, really look at him. He's still there, lost in thought, his hand absently circling the rim of his mug. He doesn't know, I realize. He doesn't know what he's about face.
 
Suddenly, I can't bear the silence.
 
I reach out, clutching his hand, forcing his attention. He looks up, his brow furrowing in concern. I swallow the lump in my throat, my heart pounding. I watch Luca, his handsome face creased in concentration, his whole body taut with the tension of our predicament. I study the sharpness of his jawline, the tired creases around his eyes, and the worried furrow of his brow. Seeing him so close to breaking, I realize that I owe him the truth.
 
I realize that all this time, I thought I was protecting him by lying, but in reality, I was protecting myself, trying to control an impossible situation.
 
The silence stretches between us, becoming an unbearable echo in the small kitchen. I glance at his hand lying open on the table. I draw a deep breath and reach across the table, placing my hand on his. The sudden contact makes him look up to meet my gaze. He sees something in my eyes; I can tell. His brow furrows even more, his hand curling around mine in a reflexive gesture of comfort despite the worry in his eyes.
 
"We need to talk, Luca," I say, my voice surprisingly steady. "There's something you need to know, something I should have told you long ago."
 
"What is it, Bella?" he asks, there's a tremor of apprehension in his voice.
 
"Do you love me, Luca?" I blurt out. The question hangs between us, echoing in the silence.
 
"Of course, I do." His answer is immediate, but I can see the confusion creeping into his gaze. "You're scaring me, Bella. What's wrong?"
 
I swallow hard, fighting back the lump in my throat. "I have a secret, Luca." My voice is just a whisper, a desperate plea hanging in the quiet air of the kitchen. "A secret I've been keeping from you."
 
His hand tightens around mine. I can see his jaw clench as he waits for me to continue. "What secret, Bella?"
 
"I'd hoped I'd never have to tell you this, but... I can't lie to you anymore, Luca. Things... things have become too dangerous. You know I was an undercover cop, but I didn't tell you the truth." My heart is hammering in my chest as I force out the words. He opens his mouth to say something, but I hold my hand to stop him. "Please, just let me finish."
 
His eyes, filled with worry and confusion, bore into mine as he nods, granting me the necessary silence. I take another deep breath, steadying myself for the confession I’m about to make.
 
"The whole heist... It was a setup." I watch Luca's eyes widen, but he stays silent, waiting for me to continue. "The police... they were in it from the start." I pause, allowing the information to sink in. "The man you knew as Ivan? The contact at the Russian Mafia?” Luca nods. “He's an undercover cop, just like me.” I watch as emotion flashes across Luca’s face. Is it anger? “The mansion, the party. It was all part of the sting. Everyone at that party, all the people you saw, they were all police officers."

The silence that descends is almost unbearable. I watch Luca's face as it morphs from shock to disbelief and finally to a look of betrayal. His grip on my hand loosens, but he doesn’t let go.
 
“Ok,” he says, the word is slow and feels heavy. “I see what you are saying, but I don’t see why this is a problem. It changes nothing. I can find another buyer for the painting. It will take time, but it can be done.”
 
"There's... there's one more thing," I stutter, my voice barely above a whisper.
 
Luca lifts his head to look at me. His face is a mask of anger and disbelief.
 
"The painting," I say, my voice trembling, "the one we've risked everything for... it's…”
 
“It's what Bella? It's fucking what?” He is almost shouting. “What are you not telling me?”
 
“It's a fake." I pause, bracing myself for his reaction. "The real one is hidden in the vaults of the National Gallery. The painting we have is worthless.”

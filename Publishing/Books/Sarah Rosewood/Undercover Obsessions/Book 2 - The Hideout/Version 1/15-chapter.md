# Chapter 15
## Bella
 
The sun's early light is bathing the room in a soft, golden glow. Blinking sleep from my eyes, I turn over, expecting to find Luca beside me but the sheets are cold. I sit up and glance around the room. I get up, grab my dressing gown, and head to the kitchen. My heart beats when I see him slumped over the table, a mug and an empty whiskey bottle on its side next to him. He's fallen asleep there, one arm folded under his head, the other draped over the table's edge. His clothes are rumpled, and there's a sheen of sweat on his forehead, the remnants of a restless sleep.
 
As I approach the table, something catches my eye. It's a small, black book, half hidden beneath Luca's slack hand. Next to it lies a burner phone, similar to the one that started this mess. My stomach churns as I pick up the book, careful not to wake him. Thumbing through the pages, I see rows upon rows of numbers, each accompanied by a name or a code. I don't recognize them, but seeing the book fills me with a cold dread. Who was Luca calling last night? A sinking feeling settles in my stomach as I stare at the worn pages. 
 
Slipping on my clothes as quietly as possible, I leave Luca sleeping at the table. My footsteps are silent against the floor as I go to the door, my heart pounding. I need some air, some space to think. As the door creaks closed behind me, I find myself stepping into the cool morning air. The sky is a delicate shade of pink. I start walking, opening the gate with precision to avoid the tinkle of the bells. I head down the lane towards the village. I'm barely aware of the path beneath me as I walk, my mind consumed by worries. 

What has Luca got us into?
 
I stop walking, my breath coming in short gasps. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, the cool air filling my lungs. I can't afford to panic, not now. We need a plan, a way out of this mess. I have to take control, for both our sakes. 

I continue my journey, my steps leading me towards the village. The sun casts a golden hue over the rustic stone houses and cobblestone streets. The village seems to have been bathed anew, the rain from the previous night washing away the dust and grime. The air is crisp and fresh, the smell of rain lingering. Sunlight glints off the pooled rainwater, creating brilliant little diamonds. As I wander through the deserted lanes, I'm struck by the serene beauty of the scene. The village looks untouched by time, its old-world charm still intact. Here and there, vines climb the stone walls of the houses, a profusion of green adding a touch of life to the scene.
 
My destination is the old red telephone box. It's a relic from another era, yet it fits perfectly with the rest of the village. Someone has lovingly transformed the interior into a makeshift flower garden, flower boxes filled with vibrant blooms taking up the floor space. The sight brings a smile to my face despite the turmoil within. It's a quintessential part of this village, a nod to the past blending seamlessly with the present. Taking a deep breath, I push open the door to the telephone box, the scent of the flowers washing over me. A whirlwind of thoughts storm through my mind as I hover my fingers over the key pad. A knot tightens in my stomach, mingling fear, determination, and desperation. I close my eyes, picturing the painting, the one thing that's been the focal point of all our problems. Opening my eyes, I take a deep, steadying breath. The smell of the flowers filling the phone box provides a strange sense of comfort, a small patch of calm in the middle of the storm.
 
I push some money into the phone slot and dial the number I had long since memorized with shaky fingers. The phone rings, and rings, and rings.
 
"Hello?" the voice is sleepy and confused. It's a voice I’ve not heard in a lifetime.
 
“Superintendant,” I say.
 
“Bella? Is that you?” His voice is alert.
 
“Yeah, it's me.” I feel tears starting to form in my eyes.
 
“Bella. Where are you? Are you safe? Is Luca with you?” His words come out in a rush.
 
“I am safe. I am in Wales.” The tears start to spill out, I can’t stop them.
 
“Wales? Where? I am relieved to hear from you,” he says. “This is some mess you have created.”
 
I take in a breath, controlling the sobs. “Yes, it is.” I pause. “I am sorry.”
 
“There will be time for apologies later; now we need to try and fix this shit show. What do you need from me? I assume the situation is… complicated.”
 
“Yes, it is complicated. But I need help. Luca plans to sell the painting and escape to France, but he doesn’t know it's a fake. I think he has contacted someone from his side and will try to sell the painting; he will get us both killed.”
 
“What do you need from me?”
 
“I am not sure. I assume you still want Luca behind bars. He killed Bianca.”
 
“Yeah, we had assumed so.”
 
“It was nothing to do with me. I couldn’t stop him, it all happened so fast.”
 
There was silence on the other end of the line. “As you said, it's complicated.”
 
“Yeah,” I agreed, but a niggle rises in my mind. “Wait, you have a plan?”
 
“No, not a plan, but our focus is still on Vittorio. We can’t have Luca running free, but he’s not the priority in the bigger picture. If he can help us put Vittorio behind bars, then perhaps…”
 
“Perhaps what?”
 
“I am not sure.”

"I am confused."

Harrison pauses. "Look Bella, we still have a chance at Vittirio but if we are going to get him then we might need Luca on our side."

I let out a little gasp. "He'll never betray his father."

"Really? You sure?"

I take a moment. Would he? To save me? "OK, what do you need from me."

I hear Harrison let out a breath. "Time. I need a few days to come up with a strategy. Can you control Luca until then?"
 
I take a breath. “I think so. Perhaps."

"Good."

I rub my eyes as if it will help my brain to focus. "You have this number," I say. "I assume you will trace where we are. Please promise you will not come in all guns blazing. Luca is armed, it could be a bloodbath. I will buy you a couple of days, a week at most. I might even be able to convince Luca to give himself up."

"Yes, that's the best approach," Harrison's voice is suddenly cold.

"If it gets worse, I'll let you know and you can come and pick him up. Otherwise I'll ring you in a few days.”
 
He sighs. “Ok.”
 
“Promise me you will not act without me knowing. Luca is unstable. If he gets a sniff of you lot coming in heavy handed, it could get very nasty.”
 
“Bella, I promise.”
 
I put down the phone.

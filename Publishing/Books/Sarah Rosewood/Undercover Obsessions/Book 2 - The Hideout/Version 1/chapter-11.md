I watch as Luca's car bounces back up the uneven dirt track. He drives past the house and then reverses back into the space next to the house, the engine's roar dying into an eerie silence. From my vantage point, I see him swing open the car door, emerging like a specter, a man with a purpose. He stands there for a moment, his figure backlit by the sun, his silhouette blending into the encroaching shadows. He rubs his face with a weariness that I've come to associate with our life on the run, his usual charismatic confidence replaced by a grim determination. He moves to the back of the car and opens the boot. For a moment, I'm unable to make out what he's doing, the contents of the boot concealed by the angle and the dwindling light. He straightens up, an array of objects cradled in his arms - a spool of sturdy wire, what looks like a fishing line, and a handful of small bells.
 
I press my hand to the cold windowpane, a foreboding creeping over me.
 
I watch as Luca strides with purpose toward the gate nestled within the dry stone wall. He kneels on the ground, the items he'd retrieved from the car now laid out beside him in an orderly fashion. It's a scene that's incongruous with the tranquil surroundings - our crumbling farmhouse, the patchwork of green fields, the peaceful Welsh landscape. He starts with the fishing line, the thin, near-invisible string unspooling easily in his practiced hands. He attaches one end to the low part of the gate, winding it securely around the iron bar. Even from this distance, I can see the focus in his eyes, the tension in his shoulders. There's an air of danger about him, a shadow of the man I fell in love with. It's terrifying and strangely magnetic. He attaches the bells, their delicate, silvery shapes glinting in the late afternoon light. Their sound is almost cheerful, a stark contrast to the grim reality of their purpose. Each chime is a reminder of the precariousness of our situation, a symbol of the paranoia that has become our constant companion. He stretches the wire across the gate's entrance, testing its tension with a pull. Satisfied, he dusts off his hands and stands back to admire his work. From where I'm standing, the wire is almost invisible, the bells quiet in the absence of wind.
 
The sun dips lower in the sky as Luca returns to the house, his task completed. Once a symbol of a warm welcome, the gate now stands as a sentry, its newly installed alarm system a grim reminder of the dangers lurking beyond our idyllic hideaway. I push open the farmhouse door, the cool evening air hitting my face as I step outside. Luca is back at the car, rummaging through the boot.
 
"Luca," I call out. "What are you doing?" He doesn't answer, his attention on whatever he's searching for in the car. "We need to talk," I persist, crossing my arms in front of me.
 
He straightens up, turning to look at me. His eyes have a hardness that I haven't seen before, a wall built out of desperation and fear. "I'm protecting you, Bella," he retorts, his voice carrying a snap that causes me to take a step back. "Nothing else."
 
"But--"
 
He grabs a bag from the car's boot and strides towards the open gate. He closes it, the bells tinkling. He brushes past and into the house. The door slams shut behind him, leaving me standing alone. The chime of the bells in the wind is the only sound that breaks the silence.

I move towards the gate, opening it with slow precision. The bells tinkle. I realize that this rudimentary alarm could be heard from the kitchen, giving us a few seconds of warning, 

I close the gate.
 
The evening breeze blows as I start my walk, moving without direction along the familiar lanes. My mind, however, is anything but calm. It whirls with the force of a tempest, lashing out at any thought of tranquility. I hug my arms around my body, a chill settling over me. As I look out over the open fields, I feel more trapped than ever.

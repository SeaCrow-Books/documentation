# Chapter 30
## Luca

I stab my hand on the car's horn, letting a long high-pitched drone escape into the countryside. Where the fuck are you, Bella? I wrestle with the steering wheel, the car protesting under my hands. The engine roars as I force the gears higher. I know I'm pushing the car to its limits. The steering wheel slips in my hands, Rico’s blood making it hard to grip. I pound the horn with the heel of my palm, each sharp beep cutting through the silence. I flick the high beams on and off in a rapid, urgent Morse code, hoping Bella can see it, hoping she knows I'm close.

I grip the wheel tighter, my knuckles white against the leather. The car surges forward, hurtling down the narrow lane. My heart pounds in time with the rhythm of the tires over the road, a frenzied tattoo that drowns out all other thoughts.

Bella, where are you?

I smash the horn again, the sound echoing off the stone walls and rolling hills. I know I'm getting close. I can feel it. I hope I'm not too late. I can't be too late, not for Bella. Not now, not after all this.

A figure staggers into lane, her silhouette thrown into stark relief against my lights. 

Bella. 

She's not just a mess, she's in a bad way. Her pristine hair is a chaotic tangle around her face, with strands matted with sweat and blood. Her face, normally a warm olive tone, is deathly pale beneath streaks of drying blood. Her arm dangles at her side, a deep gash carved into the flesh, blood still seeping from it in a steady, worrying stream. Her mouth, vibrant in its brutal redness, is smeared with blood. It drips down, painting her clothes with a sickeningly vivid stain that spreads with every labored breath she takes. She's losing a lot of blood, her strength visibly ebbing with every passing second.

My heart seizes at the sight of her, the immediate relief that she's alive swiftly replaced by panic. 

I slam on the brakes, the car screeching to a halt just feet away from her. She looks up at the sound, her gaze meeting mine through the windscreen. Her eyes have an urgency that I've never seen before, and it sends a chill down my spine. Bella lunges forward and grasps at the car door. Her hand slips from the handle and she tries again, this time she wrenches the door open. Her movements are frenzied, desperate. She throws herself into the passenger seat, her breaths coming in short, ragged gasps. Her fingers clutch the fabric of her bloody clothes, knuckles white, as she leans back against the seat. She looks over at me, her eyes intense and imploring.

"Bella," I breathe, my voice barely above a whisper. 

I'm suddenly hyperaware of the heat of her body next to mine, the rapid rise and fall of her chest, and the desperate vulnerability in her gaze. It's a stark contrast to the confident, self-assured woman I know her to be.

"I've got you," I promise, my voice thick with emotion.

I throw the car back into gear and floor the accelerator, the car lurching forward. Bella winces. 

"I've got you," I say, more to myself than to her.

I push the car forward to a gap in the hedge. A large steel fence blocks the entrance to the field, but its enough room for me to turn. I nose the car in the gap and then into reverse. The car shoots backward, the rear end plowing into the hedge behind. Bella lets out a grunt. I look at her. I see her eyes are closed. I am unsure if she is unconscious or just trying to deal with the pain. I drag the wheel, turning the car. I hit the accelerator and head back the way I had come.

I glance over at her and see her eyes are open. She forces a smile.

'I knew you would come,' she says, her voice no more than a whisper.

'Always,' I say. Her eyes flutter shut. I glance back at the lane ahead as I push the car forward. “Where's my father?" I manage to croak out, my throat feeling tight. I don't dare take my eyes off the road, but I can feel Bella turning her head to look at me.

"He's dead," she says.

I swallow hard, the lump in my throat growing larger. A sense of relief and guilt washes over me, too intertwined to differentiate one from another.

"Are you okay?" I ask, my voice barely a whisper.

She lifts a hand to her mouth, wiping away fresh blood that trickles down her chin. It is like she is moving in slow motion. I look at the cut on her arms, it's deep. She’s not alright.

I feel a knot tighten in my stomach. "Bella," I say, a dozen words of comfort and consolation on the tip of my tongue. But I can't seem to form any of them into a coherent sentence. I grip the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles white with tension. I muster up the courage to speak again. "It's going to be okay," I assure her, the words feeling hollow as they leave my lips.

The cottage looms into view, nestled in quaint seclusion. As we speed past, I glimpse its innocuous facade, the stone walls standing sentinel against the gloom. I can't help but contemplate the chaos it masks, the blood-spattered scene tucked away in the shadows of its rustic charm. It's bizarre, in a way. That something so quiet and unassuming could hold such violence. The cottage recedes in the rearview mirror, its image growing smaller and fainter until it finally disappears. 

Bella's body is slumped against the door. She is still bleeding. Her labored breathing fills the car, each gasp sounding more pained than the last. Her blood stains the seat, a vivid red smear growing larger by the second. Her arm hangs by her side, the deep cut obvious even in the dim light. She needs medical attention. Urgently. Panic prickles at the back of my mind, a constant thrum of fear and uncertainty. The adrenaline rush is starting to fade, replaced by the cold reality of our situation. We've escaped immediate danger, but we're far from safe.

Disjointed and desperate, a plan starts to form in my mind.

I need to get Bella to the hospital, but the police will be looking for me and this car.

A breath.

I'll drive us out of the village, find a farm, and leave the car on some secluded road. These farmers never lock their cars up; I’ll find a vehicle, anything. Then, find a hospital and get Bella patched up. It's risky, but it's our best shot.

No, wait.

A breath.

Rico said that they had buried Bianca. It might be that the police are not even looking for us.

If that’s the case then the police will not be looking for me.

Breath.

But the gunshot, a car driving wildly. Locals notice these things. Phone calls will have been made. The police will come looking.

Breath.

But they will be slow, it will take ages.

Breath.

How long do I have?

Breath.

Bella is dying.

Breath.

Bella.

Fuck.

The junction to the main road looms ahead of me, and I slam on the brakes, slowing the car. I take a breath, slow and steady. A second. A third. I guide the car closer to the junction. A different future lies in either direction - right would lead us up to the deceptive safety of the hills, left would take us back into the lion's den of the village. The choice hovers in my mind, unmade, a precipice I teeter on.

But before I can decide, the world chooses for me.

Vehicles materialize as if from the ether. They come from my right. Lights are flashing; they see me and pull to a halt, blocking me in. Six Ford Mondeos, gleaming white under the harsh beams of their headlights. The yellow and blue stripes of the Battenburg pattern run along their sides, over their hoods and trunks, screaming authority in this silent, rural setting. The word ‘POLICE’ is emblazoned on the doors in reflective lettering, standing out like a beacon in the semi-darkness. The flashing blue lights atop each vehicle add to the disorientation, casting long, spectral shadows that dance eerily in the murk.

I glance over at Bella. Her eyes are closed. She looks like she is sleeping.

Police spill from the cars. They are clad in black tactical uniforms. Their body armor bears the unmistakable insignia of the Metropolitan Police. Across their chests and back, black webbing harnesses carry various gear, from radios to first-aid kits. But the most distinct equipment, signaling their specific and formidable role, were the firearms. Each officer carries a Heckler & Koch carbine rifle, its matte black surface gleaming faintly in the low light. Holstered semi-automatic pistols waited on their thighs, a secondary line of defense. 

They fan out, guns pointed in my direction. I could run, slam the car in reverse and try to escape. I glance at Bella. Her face is absent of colour. She needs help now.

I lift my hands from the steering wheel. 

My gaze is drawn to a figure standing away from the fleet of vehicles. He's tall, and ruggedly built, with a strong stance that speaks volumes of his confidence and experience. Short, salt-and-pepper hair crowns his head. His well-cut suit contrasts the surrounding chaos, lending him an air of calm authority. He smiles at me.

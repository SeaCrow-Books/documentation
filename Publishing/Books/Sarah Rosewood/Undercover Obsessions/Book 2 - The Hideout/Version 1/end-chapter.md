Do you really trust your husband?

 That’s what I had to decide. I had it all. At least, that’s what people told me. Beauty, brains, and a rich husband. I deserved it too. My fiancé had cheated on me with my best friend. But I won in the end, or at least I thought I had.

 Until Christmas of 1999. My ex-fiancé, Danny, showed up at my parents’ house, wanting to talk to my father. Danny’s a police officer, and my father’s a retired officer. A six-year-old girl had disappeared without a trace, resembling a case my father had worked on years earlier.

 My parents still loved Danny. The gregarious local cop. A man’s man with manners. What’s not to love? My introverted and awkward husband, Jason, couldn’t compete. My parents weren’t impressed by his money. Jason’s job in finance was too abstract. He made money from other people’s money, like a banker or a loan shark.

 I think this made it easier for my family to blame Jason. They were right to blame him. He was alone with her. It was his DNA. It was an impossible choice for me. My family or my husband. I suppose we all made our own choices. We were never the same after that. We all suffered from his terrible crime.

 Twenty years later, I had a happy life and a happy family. I wanted to forget the past, but it all came back, forcing me to choose all over again. This time we couldn’t bury the secrets. Jason. Danny. My parents. My daughter. All those missing girls.

 Never in a million years could I have seen it coming.

 What readers are saying
 “Mr. Williams is an amazing author. His storylines are some of the best I've read and I read a lot. I average about 135 books a year. His writing is like silky poetry. That may be an unusual way to describe someone's writing style but that's the way it feels to me. He is very talented.” - AMB ★★★★★

 I am an avid reader and seldom come across a book this good. It was brilliant. Awesome plot, well-written, fantastic characters. This was the real deal.” - Mark ★★★★★

 “This was my first book by this author, and all I can say is, WOW. Pick this one up early unless you want to stay up all night with it. It's a page turner that can't be put down.” - Kindle Reader ★★★★★

 “This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I was unable to put it down once I started to read it.” - L. Hayden ★★★★★

 “Phil Williams is probably my favorite author right now...I love his writing style and he writes the type of books that I want to stay up all night to finish. I read several books a month and get excited every time I come across a new one by this author. Redemption drew me in from the first chapter and I couldn't wait to finish reading it. You feel very much like you're in a movie in your mind with his vivid and descriptive character development and I get emotionally invested very quickly. I appreciate that he is not afraid to confront the hard issues either and does so in a tasteful and enlightening manner. Finished this book in day and look forward to my next Phil Williams read." - Jessica ★★★★★

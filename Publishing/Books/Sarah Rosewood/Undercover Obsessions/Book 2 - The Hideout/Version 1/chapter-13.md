## Bella
 
I tuck my knees closer to my chest, wrapping my arms around them, as if trying to hold together the fragments of my own breaking heart. The room, though familiar, feels cold and distant, and the silence is almost suffocating. Each breath I take is a sharp reminder of the growing chasm between Luca and me. The man I thought I knew, whose love and strength had been my anchor, is slipping away right before my eyes. 
A stray tear slips down my cheek, the cool track it leaves a sharp contrast to the warmth of my skin. I feel lost, adrift in an ocean of uncertainty, desperately searching for a lifeline. The one thing I'm sure of is that I can't bear to lose him, not to whatever demons are plaguing him. But the question remains: How do I bring back the Luca I know and love when he seems so determined to keep his walls up?
 
The door creak jolts me back to reality. Luca stands in the doorway, filling the room even from that distance. His eyes, usually warm and inviting, are now cold and analytical, scanning me as if I'm a puzzle he's trying to decipher. There's no warmth, no recognition; it's as if he's seeing me but not really seeing me. Every muscle in my body tenses under his gaze. I feel like a deer caught in the headlights, my heart hammering against my chest. His scrutiny feels predatory, a stark contrast to the loving glances we once shared. A chill runs down my spine, and for a moment, I'm paralyzed by a mix of fear and uncertainty.
 
The air in the room grows thick, the weight of our unspoken emotions pressing down on me. I want to reach out, to ask him what's going on, to bridge this growing distance between us. But his gaze pins me in place, the intensity making it hard to breathe. I feel exposed, vulnerable, like a piece of art under harsh scrutiny. Deep down, I know this isn't the Luca I fell in love with. This transformation, this cold detachment, terrifies me more than anything. The man standing before me feels like a stranger, and I can't help but wonder what's causing this drastic change.
 
Yet, he is still my master. I still feel that I must submit to him. That is what we agreed. I still want to make him happy.
 
“Stand up,” he says, not breaking eye contact. I smile, but he remains emotionless. “Bella, I gave you an order, you know the rules. Stand up.”
 
I hesitate for a moment, but I shuffle to the end of the bed and stand.
 
"Kneel," he orders.
 
The word hangs in the air, and a mix of emotions crashes over me. My mind races, trying to piece together the meaning behind the request. Fear, uncertainty, and a hint of defiance mingle within me. 

As my knees slowly bend, the cool floor beneath sends a shiver up my spine. My eyes remain locked on his, searching for any flicker of the warmth I once knew. The position feels unnatural, my heart pounding in my ears. Yet, despite my apprehension, a tiny sliver of trust remains. That trust nudges me, reminding me of the connection we once shared. But as I settle into my position, the weight of our current reality presses heavily on my chest, and I'm left yearning for answers.
 
The room becomes a vacuum, the tension between us thick enough to slice through. As Luca strides forward, each step deliberate and echoing with authority, he stops directly in front of me. The sound of his zipper cuts through the silence, and a rush of emotions threatens to overwhelm me. He pushes his hand into his trousers and produces his cock. It is hard. A thought flicks through my mind. I imagine my lips engulfing his cock. I bat away the image, hating that I want him so much despite everything.
 
A deep breath escapes me, steadying my nerves as I wait for his next command.
 
“Fucking suck me whore.”
 
I shuffle forward without hesitation and take his cock in my mouth. My hand grips his shaft. I prepare myself to please him. I feel his hand grab the back of my head and he pushes my face onto his cock. I gag as the shaft pushes into my throat. He ignores me. He holds my head in place, his hand wrapped in my hair. I feel him move his hips, slow at first but then harder and faster. Before I can act he is fucking my mouth. I hear him pant and a low grunt slips from his lips. I release his cock and steady myself as he continues to fuck my face. I focus on staying still and balanced while his cock plunges into me, the tip deep in my mouth.
 
“Fucking yes,” he says.
 
He moves faster, his cock in my mouth, his hand on my head. My eyes are squeezed shut as I try not to gag. All other thoughts fall from my mind. I forget about the danger, trying to escape and the situation we are in. I focus on Luca's cock and making sure that I can be what he needs. In this moment, that is all I am. Time stops. I am focusing on breathing through my nose. I let him use me. I let him fuck my mouth for his pleasure. I am an object for his pleasure. My mouth is his. I am his. This excites me.
 
“Yes,” he says, his voice is almost a bark.
 
His cum takes me by surprise. I try to relax as the hot liquid squirts into my throat. I swallow, letting his seed flow into me.
 
I feel him relax. He slips his cock from my mouth.
 
“Good girl,” he says. He leans down and kisses my forehead. 

I feel a spark of pleasure wash over me.
 
He pushes his cock into his trousers, zips himself up and turns, heading back to the kitchen. I watch as he walks from my view.
 
I stand, dress, and follow Luca, padding barefoot into the kitchen. He is sitting at the table, looking out of the window. I fill the kettle and flick it on, the quiet hum filling the otherwise silent farmhouse. The cool stone under my feet, the soft glow of the moonlight filtering through the window, it all feels surreal yet incredibly real at the same time. As I reach for the teabags, I can't help but let out a small, disbelieving laugh. We're fugitives, hiding in an old farmhouse, on the run from... well, a life we didn't ask for but one that we're inexplicably entangled in now. And yet, here I am, making tea like it's just another ordinary day. 

Pouring the hot water into the cups, I watch as the tea infuses, the rich brown color slowly spreading. 
 
"Tea," I murmur, a small smile playing on my lips as I hand him his cup. 

A simple gesture, a moment of connection amidst the chaos, a quiet reminder that we're still together despite it all. As I sink into the worn couch, cradling my tea in my hands, I find my gaze drifting back towards Luca. 

There's an unspoken question hanging heavily in the air, its weight threatening to pull me under. The tension of the last few weeks has strained us to breaking point, and the silent resignation etched onto Luca's face in sleep is the final straw. A sense of clarity crystallizes within me, the fog of fear and uncertainty slowly lifting. This can't go on. We can't keep living like this, trapped in a constant cycle of fear and flight, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
 
A stark realization uncoils within me. The painting - our supposed ticket to freedom and a new life - is not our salvation. It's our damnation. It's a fake, a beautifully crafted deception.
 
Luca doesn't know this.
 
He sees it as our key to safety, our escape route. Yet, it's anything but that. I was right; the fake is good and looks real for the man on the street. But Luca is not selling to a man on the street. 

This isn't about my fears or insecurities anymore. This is a matter of life and death.

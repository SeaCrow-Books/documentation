# Chapter 1
## Bella
 
The stone walls of the Welsh cottage are etched and scored by the countless seasons of harsh weather. The slate roof seems to weigh heavy on the small house, pushing it down into the hillside. Inside, our world is a blend of rustic charm and makeshift modernity. The small kitchen is a testament to this, with worn appliances arranged in a cozy, cluttered state around the room. The centerpiece is a single sink, bearing the chips and marks of age, worn but not weary. As I make tea, the generator hums in the background. It has taken me a few days to get used to the constant hum, but now I hardly notice it. The tang of boiling water mixing with the blend of tea leaves fills the air with a familiar aroma.

I look up from the cup to the window. Its imperfect glass and wooden frame serve as a frame to the world outside. Through it, I can see Luca. He has set up his easel and is looking out across the valley. He paints with a devotion that stirs warmth within me. Luca, bathed in the glow of the late afternoon sun, is a figure carved of passion and perseverance. He stands tall, lean but not gaunt. The sun's dying light etches highlights on his weather-beaten skin, casting a warm, golden glow that adds depth to his raw and honest beauty. His dark hair dances in the slight breeze, rebellious, just like him. It frames a face that could be chiseled from stone, strong jawline softened by the kindness radiating from his deep-set eyes, which sparkle with an undying sense of wonder for the world. His hands, smeared with paint, move with an artist's grace, flowing across the canvas in smooth, assured strokes.

Watching Luca in his element, against the backdrop of our weathered cottage and rolling hills, is akin to viewing a masterfully crafted live painting - an interplay of light, color, and emotion that is profoundly beautiful. A love for him fills every corner of my heart, every inch of our home, every stroke of his brush on the canvas, and every sunset we watch together in comfortable silence. Each moment strengthens our shared connection.

Luca stops painting, his brush hanging suspended in mid-air before he places it on his palette. He turns and our eyes meet. The corners of his lips curl into a soft smile.

I push open the cottage door and make my way towards him, my heart fluttering in my chest as it always does when he is close. Reaching him, I am engulfed in the familiar scent of paint and earth, the aroma as comforting as it is intoxicating. His arms wrap around me, pulling me close, and our lips meet in a kiss. His hand drifts down to my wrist, his fingers exploring the fresh mark circling it. The skin is tender, the bruised area marked by a fiery red contrast against my otherwise pale skin - a souvenir of the previous night. He lifts my wrist to his lips and kisses the mark. I untangle myself from his arms, planting a kiss on his stubbled cheek before turning to return inside.

The cottage's warmth greets me. I close the door behind me and immerse myself in the cottage's stillness. The residual aroma of the freshly brewed tea still lingers in the air, mingling with the earthy scent of the timbered walls. I let my fingers trace along the worn wooden counter, the touch grounding me in the reality of the moment.

My thoughts begin to wander, tracing the tumultuous path that has led us here, to this tiny corner of Wales. This secret haven is far removed from the chaos of the life we once knew. Luca has managed the impossible – keeping me safe, hidden from the grasp of the police and the relentless pursuit of his family. Gazing into the empty room, I realize how much this rustic cottage has become our sanctuary. I had been surprised when Luca drove us here. The last place I had expected to find myself was tucked away in a Welsh valley, but Luca had explained that it was safe. It turned out he’d secretly bought the cottage years ago. It was a place where he could escape to paint and hide his secret. Now it is hiding a new, more dangerous secret.

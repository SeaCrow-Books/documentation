# Chapter 17
## Bella
 
Walking down the serene country lane leading to our cottage, the morning light bounces off the wet slate. Luca walks beside me, our steps in sync, yet there's an ocean of unsaid words between us. Our cottage peaks over the hedges in the distance. We draw closer. The door to the cottage is wide open. Everything else is as we left it.

"Did you leave the door open?" Luca's question shatters the oppressive silence, his words hanging heavy in the air.
 
I shake my head, a flicker of fear in my eyes. "No, I closed it. I'm sure of it."
 
He nods, his face hardening with determination. "Wait here." Luca moves towards the cottage but avoids the gate. Instead, he pulls himself over the waist high wall and advances towards the door, his body tensed and ready for any threat. I hesitate for a moment and then step towards the low wall. 
 
"I'm coming with you," I assert.
 
He glances back at me, worry and resignation in his eyes. He nods. I pull myself onto the wall, he holds out his hand to steady me but I ignore it and clamber over. He shrugs and turns to the cottage, padding forward. I follow close behind, my heart pounding in my chest. He hesitates at the door before we head inside. I scan the room. At first glance, the kitchen appears as we left it: the well-used table, the fireplace, the old-fashioned floral print couch beckoning from the corner. But as my gaze wanders, I notice a chair out of place, its lone presence disrupting the room's harmony. My attention falls on the drawers; they have been pulled open, but their contents seem untouched. A shiver of dread courses through me. Once a refuge, the quaint charm of our cottage has been violated.
 
Luca puts a hand on my arm. His eyes mirror my concern. “Stay here,” he whispers. “I’ll check the house.” 
 
I nod and glance behind me, out of the door into the brightness outside. I turn back. My eyes readjust to the dim light of the cottage to see the black shape of a gun in Luca’s hand. I don't know where it came from, he must have been carrying it. I watch as he disappears out of the kitchen, his figure swallowed by the dim light. Minutes stretch into eternity as I wait, my heart pounding. He reappears, his face etched with lines of worry.
 
"Someone's been in here," Luca says, his voice low and grim. His gaze sweeps the room, taking in the chaotic state of the cottage, a visible testament to the violation we've just experienced. “They are gone.”
 
"Maybe it was just kids or walkers," I suggest, attempting to convince myself as much as him.
 
Luca gives me a skeptical look. "When's the last time you saw a kid in these parts, or a walker that looked like they'd break into someone's house?"
 
I falter. "Never."
 
Luca's hand finds mine, the warmth of his grip a small comfort in the cold reality of our situation. "We're going to have to be careful. We're not as alone as we thought. Stay put," Luca orders, his voice ringing with authority. "Lock the doors and windows. I'm going to check the perimeter."
 
I watch as he tucks his gun into the waistband of his jeans, pulling his coat on over it. He gives me one last lingering look before stepping out into the morning light, the door shutting behind him with a dull thud that echoes in the silence of the cottage. With a shaky breath, I move to lock the door, my fingers fumbling over the cool metal of the bolt. I check the windows, ensuring each latch is securely in place. I can't help but feel trapped, like a bird in a cage. I'm alone, and the wait for Luca's return feels like an eternity. The only thing that keeps me grounded is the small flame of determination that burns within me. I mustn't let fear take over. I have a role to play and must play it well, no matter the cost. A wave of emotion surges within me, threatening to capsize my stability. My heart throbs painfully in my chest, a palpable echo of the fear that pulses through my veins. My breath catches in my throat as an all-too-familiar sense of helplessness washes over me. I'm no stranger to this feeling, the gnawing fear that stems from the uncertainty of undercover work. 

But this... this feels different. 

It's sharper, more visceral. It claws at my insides with a ferocity I've never experienced, each heartbeat amplifying the dread that looms over me like a storm cloud. The fear threatens to overwhelm me, the cottage walls closing in as the weight of my dread presses heavily on my chest. I fight to catch my breath, my mind scrambling for control amidst the chaos. 

I can't afford to break down, not now.
 
But it's hard. 

God, it's hard. 

My knees feel weak. I stagger from the kitchen and into the bedroom. I sink onto the bed, burying my face as I try to contain the storm within me. I take a deep, shuddering breath, trying to steady myself and quell the tide of fear that threatens to drown me.
 
"I can do this," I whisper, clinging to the thread of hope that weaves through the despair. "I have to do this." My voice is barely audible, drowned out by the deafening silence of the cottage, but I cling to the words like a lifeline.
 
I can feel my mind spiraling, my thoughts tumbling over one another in a disordered flurry of fear and confusion. I can't think straight. I need to focus on devising a plan, but the terror gnawing at my insides makes it almost impossible.

I curl into the fetal position, my knees drawn up to my chest, my body mimicking the tight coil of fear within me. I'm cocooned in the softness of the duvet, hidden away from the harsh realities that lie beyond its comforting confines. My eyes squeeze shut. Sobs begin to wrack my body, each one tearing from deep within my chest, raw and unbidden. The pent-up terror and helplessness spill forth in these salty tears, my body convulsing with the effort of each shaky breath. The taste of fear and despair floods my senses as I allow myself this moment of weakness, this release from the ironclad control I've been desperately clinging to.

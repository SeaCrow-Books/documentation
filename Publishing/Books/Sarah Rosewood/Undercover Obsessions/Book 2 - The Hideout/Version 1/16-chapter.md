# Chapter 16 
## Luca
 
My eyes snap open to the unfamiliar stiffness of the kitchen chair under me, the sharp smell of stale whiskey hitting my nostrils. The memories of last night come rushing back, their sharp edges dulled by the murky hangover fog. I glance down at the burner phone and the small, worn-out address book open beside it. I had called Rico, that much I remember. Panic flares in my chest, a wildfire sparked by the realization that Bella could have seen it. I push up from the table, every joint in my body protesting. The kitchen is cold, still shrouded in the quiet chill of early morning. The chair scrapes against the floor, the noise sharp and intrusive. Bella is nowhere in sight. I call her name, but the cottage swallows the sound, offering nothing in return. With a growing sense of unease, I walk to the bedroom. The bedroom door creaks open under my touch, revealing the rumpled bed, sheets cold and vacant. The room is bathed in soft light, everything still and silent. I run a hand through my hair, a cold sensation creeping up my spine. 
 
Bella's been gone for a while. The realization hits me like a punch to the gut. My mind is a whirl of thoughts. She must have seen the phone, seen the book. She must know. The fear, sharp and clear, takes hold. 
 
Where is Bella?
 
The sudden tinkle of the bells sends my heart into my throat. Adrenaline courses through my veins, clearing the fog in my mind as I whip around toward the noise. I rush into the kitchen, my breath caught in anticipation. The door creaks open, and Bella pushes her way in. Relief washes over me, but it's short-lived as I take in her state. Her eyes are rimmed with red. Her face is pale and drawn, the deep worry lines etched across her forehead making her seem older, worn out. I realize she's been crying.
 
"Bella," I breathe out, my voice coming out in a raspy whisper.
 
Her eyes meet mine, and something in her gaze sends a chill down my spine. It's a look I've seen before. Something has happened. Something that's rattled Bella to the core.
 
"Where have you been?" I ask, my voice sharper than I intend. She glances at me, her gaze steady as she lifts the milk bottle she clutches like a lifeline.
 
"Just to get milk," she responds. She seems distracted.
 
The silence hangs between us like a heavy shroud. She sets the milk on the counter, the light clink of glass against the wooden surface breaking the tense quiet. I reach into a drawer, my hand closing around a large kitchen knife's cold, comforting grip. Its weight in my hand brings a momentary sense of control, a fleeting illusion amidst the storm that's about to break loose. With a swift movement, I produce the knife, the gleam of the sharp blade catching the morning sunlight. Bella gasps, her eyes widening in fear, and she steps back.
 
"No, Bella," I say. "It's not for you."
 
The fear in her eyes doesn't vanish entirely but confusion mixes in. My heart aches at her evident terror. She must have thought... I let my hand, the one holding the knife, drop to my side to show her she's not in danger. The other hand reaches out to her, grasping her slender fingers.
 
"Come with me," I tell her, my voice softened to a whisper. "It's okay."
 
She hesitates but then gives a small nod. Her hand feels cold and fragile in mine, but she follows me, her trust still intact despite the initial scare. 

In silence, we make our way up the winding lane, our footfalls creating a steady rhythm against the path. The morning is alive with birdsong, a myriad of melodious chirps that fill the air with a tranquil symphony of nature. It would be idyllic if the situation wasn't so serious. We walk for a few minutes until we come to a break in the hedges. I stop and turn into the field. Ahead, partially hidden by sporadic clusters of gorse and heather, lies the shepherd's hut. The structure sits in unassuming dignity on the undulating hillside of Snowdonia. Constructed from locally quarried stone, the hut carries an aura of enduring resilience, its haphazardly stacked blocks of stone mirroring the untamed ruggedness of its surroundings. As we near the hut, the panoramic vista of the sprawling valley below is unveiled - verdant fields punctuated by the tiny fleecy forms of grazing sheep, rolling hills rising and falling like the gentle waves of a green sea. The morning mist clings to the valley, adding a layer of mystic charm.
 
I walk into the hut, making sure that Bella is following me. My eyes take a moment to adjust to the murk. The interior is sparse and rudimentary. The air smells musty. The floor is made from pack mud, but grass and weeds have invaded the space. I bend down at the back of the shepherd's hut. The stones under my hands feel cool and rough. I wedge the knife between the stones, where the hut meets the ground, and the long blade disappears into a small crevice. The handle is all but hidden, just a faint glimmer of metal visible. Pushing some loose soil and a handful of small pebbles over it, I stand back and survey the spot. Even knowing it's there, I can barely make it out. The knife blends perfectly with the weather-beaten stones and moss that creep up the hut's sides. The morning light is still soft, casting long shadows that further shroud the hiding spot.
 
I turn to Bella, feeling a surge of relief. "Can you see it?" I ask, my voice barely more than a whisper. My eyes stay fixed on her, studying her expression, trying to gauge her reaction. 

“Only if I look hard,” she says.
 
“Good.” I step forward and hug her. She pulls back.
 
“What’s going on Luca?”
 
I take a breath. “Bella, if the shit hits the fan, I want you to run.”
 
“I know, you said that but the shit isn’t going-”
 
“Bella,” I cut her off. “Listen, we need to be practical. This is important. If the shit hits the fan, I want you to get out of the house and run. Come here. It's safe. The knife is for your protection, just in case.”
 
“I am sure it will be ok,” says Bella.
 
I nod. “Yeah, but humor me, please.”
 
She smiles. “If the shit hits the fan, I will leave the house and head here.”
 
“You will run and hide until I can come and find you... unless you have to fight.”
 
“I’ll hide unless I have to fight,” Bella says.

I look at Bella, she seems scared.
 
“Good girl. Look, this is never going to happen but I need to know you are ready, understand?" She nods. "Good. OK, please listen. If you have to use the knife, then aim for the vulnerable areas like the eyes, throat, and groin. You are not trying to kill anyone. The goal is to incapacitate the attacker swiftly and get away. You need to hit them in a place that will stop them. Rapid stabs and slashes can be more effective than long, drawn-out motions. If you have to fight then you fight like a demon.”
 
“Ok,” her voice is little more than a whisper.

"Like a demon," I say, looking in her eyes. "You don't stop."

"Yes," she says, "Like a demon."
 
“Good. I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
 
She makes eye contact. “What if…”
 
“What if what?”
 
She smiles. “Nothing, it's a good plan. You are right; we need to be pragmatic.” I step forward and hug her. “Why the sudden urgency?”
 
I hesitate. “I started the ball moving; we have a couple of days at most. We need to be ready to move at a moment's notice.”
 
“What have you done, Luca?” she asks. Her face seems to be full of fear.
 
“I have taken control,” I say.

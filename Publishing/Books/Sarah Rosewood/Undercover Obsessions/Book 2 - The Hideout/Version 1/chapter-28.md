## Luca
 
The Land Rover's imposing silhouette looms in the shadows, the vehicle's tinted windows obscuring the passengers. As the lights flick off and the doors open, my heartbeat quickens.
 
Two figures emerge.
 
First, there's Rico. A beast of a man, his hulking frame fills up the vehicle's doorway. His shaved head reflects the vapid sun, making him look all the more menacing. His face, clean-shaven and rigid, is highlighted by a pair of sharp, piercing brown eyes that seem to dissect everything they see. He steps out in casual attire - jeans, a plain T-shirt, and a worn leather jacket.  

Following him out of the vehicle is my father. A man of stark contrast to Rico, yet just as intimidating in his own right. He's older, his physique a testament to a life of excess. His former good looks have given way to bloated features, the remnants of his hair carefully styled to hide the balding scalp. His overweight figure, clad in an expensive tailored suit, silk tie, and glossy leather shoes, hints at his amassed wealth. But his hands always command my attention - large, calloused, and scarred.
 
I tear my gaze away from them, turning towards Bella, who stands frozen in our kitchen doorway, her eyes wide with fear. "Bella," I say, trying to keep my voice steady. "My father's here. Get inside, now."
 
At my command, her paralysis breaks, and she nods, her mug of tea forgotten on the doorstep as she disappears into the safety of the cottage. I hear the faint sound of her footsteps retreating before turning to face the two men. They're out of the car and heading for the small gate. It is almost comical as Rico bends, unlatches the gate and pushes it open to the sound of bells. A flash of confusion floods across his face. He steps through and Father follows. He stands with his arms crossed over his expansive chest, his face unreadable in the shadow of the night. Beside him, Rico's hawk-like eyes are fixated on me, a silent promise of a confrontation yet to come.
 
My hand reaches for the gun holstered at my back, my fingers brushing against the cold metal.
 
"I can't believe you betrayed me Rico," I growl, staring at the man I'd considered a confidant, maybe even a friend. "I thought you were different. I thought you wouldn't choose sides."
 
Rico smirks, shaking his head. "Did you really think I'd betray the man who has protected me my whole life, Luca?” He glances at my father. “You've always been so self-absorbed, always thinking only of yourself."
 
"Rico's more of a son to me than you ever were," my father says, his voice resonating with a bitterness I never thought I'd hear.
 
His words cut deep, ripping into old wounds. It's one thing to disappoint your father, but hearing that he considers the man who betrayed you as more of a son is a whole other level of hurt. I feel myself stagger backward, reeling from the blow. My father’s eyes meet mine, and I see a hardness that chills me. He takes a step forward, his gaze never wavering from mine.
 
"You stopped being my son," he declares, his voice cold and without warmth, "the moment you took the life of the woman I loved."
 
His words are like a punch to the gut, knocking my breath out. Bianca... the memory of her death is still raw.
 
"What do you know about love?" I scoff back, feeling the heat rise within me. "She never loved you. She was only interested in what you could give her and what she could take. She was happy to take whatever was on offer, I should know. Your concept of love is based on some distorted fantasy, twisted by greed and lust."
 
His smirk never falters. "You think I never knew what Bianca was? Do you think I never saw through her games? At least I understand the realities of this world, boy," he retorts. "You've lived in a sissy Disney movie your whole life."
 
I laugh. "I may have watched Disney movies, but at least I have a heart. I can feel; I can love. I don't see women as objects of pleasure, as a pair of false tits."

There is a moment of silence. I lock eyes with my father.
 
"Perhaps Bella should be part of this conversation," he suggests, his eyes flicking past me to the cottage behind.
 
"No," I say. 

Rico pulls a gun from his jacket. The world seems to hold its breath in the silence that follows. 

"It's okay, Bella," I call out, straining against the deafening silence.
 
I turn to see Bella emerging from the cottage, her eyes wide and filled with fear. "Come here," I tell her, moving closer to the cottage, wanting to put some distance between us and the men. As Bella steps into the dim light. My father’s eyes shift to her, a new interest sparking in his gaze.
 
“So what do you think, little missy?” my father asks Bella.
 
Bella looks at Luca and sighs. “Luca is right,” she says, “Love is more than owning things, it is about emotion.” Bella pauses, taking a deep breath as she gathers her thoughts. "Love isn't just about passion or romantic gestures. It's about charity and kindness. It's about being gentle with what's broken and disgraced in each other and ourselves because one day, we'll all require that gentleness. Love is having the imagination to see beyond the surface, to understand the pain that has led someone to where they are. It's about knowing that everyone deserves sympathy and mercy, even those who've made mistakes. And it's about forgiveness, understanding that we all have our darkness to deal with."

Rico scoffs, a smirk dancing on his lips. "Who do you think you are? Shakespeare?" A coarse laugh breaks from my father.

I take Bella's hand, guiding her a step back towards the safety of the cottage. I lean in close, my voice barely a whisper. "When you get the chance, run," I instruct her. My gaze meets hers, full of conviction and determination. Bella nods, squeezing his hand in understanding. ”You know where to go.”

I return my gaze to Father and Rico. We stand, silhouetted in the mist.

I break the silence with a hollow laugh, the sound almost foreign to my ears in the quiet stillness of the night. "So, what happens now?" I ask, my voice taking on a resigned edge. My eyes flicker to Rico, to the gun. "I assume I don't get the passports?" 
 
Rico's sneer gleams through the dimly lit space between us, a wolfish grin that dances dangerously beneath the slivers of moonlight filtering through the tree canopy overhead. "You always were the funny one," he grunts, his low voice echoing with sinister amusement.
 
I hoist a smile onto my face, a thin veneer that does little to conceal the palpable tension coursing through my veins. "And the good-looking one," I say.
 
"This is no time for joking," my father says.
 
"Right," I agree, my tone mockingly placid. But beneath the light banter, adrenaline thrums through my body like a drumbeat, each pulse urging me to act. "We need to talk; I get it." I glance to Bella. "Run, Bella, run." My voice cleaves through the shocked silence, echoing off the stone cottage.
 
I tense and release, hurling myself at Rico, using all my strength and momentum to knock the broad-shouldered man off balance. He stumbles and topples into my father. Our bodies intertwine. We crash to the ground in a whirl of limbs and grunts, the force of my tackle driving him into the earth. The gun is jarred loose. It skitters off into the shadows towards the wall. My father staggers backward. He teeters on the brink of the garden gate, the weight of his frame threatening to topple him over as he struggles to regain his balance.

From the corner of my eye, I catch a fleeting glimpse of Bella, her form a blur in the dim light as she breaks into a run. She shoves past the reeling bulk of my father with surprising force, sending him off-balance once more. Her feet pad on the path, each step echoing like a desperate heartbeat in the hush of the night. She's racing up the lane, fleeing from the danger. 

Good girl. 
 
Rico's muscular form shifts, pinning me to the floor. He appears above me, his body pinning me down with an inescapable weight. His fist flies towards my face, and a burst of stars blinds me as the impact resonates through my skull.
 
"I got this," Rico grunts, his voice rough and breathless from the struggle. "Go get her."
 
I crack open my eyes in time to see my father turn, his overweight form heaving as he takes off at a lumbering run. The sight of him pursuing Bella sets a chilling dread pooling in my gut. The sound of his heavy footfalls grows fainter as he disappears into the gloom of the lane.
 
Rico glances to follow my eyes, and I see my chance. I jerk my legs, catching Rico. I hear a groan, and his weight lessens. I kick again. My knee connects with his balls, and he lets out a gruff gasp of pain. He shifts backward off my body, but still on his knees. I extract myself from under Rico's writhing body and jump to my feet. My vision swirls. My hand reaches towards my back for the gun but it's not there. My eyes sweep over the ground around us, but the weapon is nowhere to be seen.
 
Rico is still kneeling, gasping for breath, a hand covering his groin. Seizing the opportunity, I draw back my leg to deliver a powerful kick to his face. His hand shoots up and my kick deflects off his arm. I stagger backward. Rico pushes himself to his feet, slamming his body into mine. I find myself toppling back, landing hard on the ground.
 
Rico surges forward with a snarl, his eyes blazing with a lethal mix of fury and determination. I throw myself out of his path, rolling away from him in a desperate scramble for distance. As I get up, my heart pounding in my chest, my eyes fall on the gleam of the discarded gun lying against the wall. Rico's gaze follows mine, his dark eyes narrowing. For a frozen moment, we stand still, both fully aware of the gravity of our situation.
 
"Rico, it doesn't have to be this way," I say, my voice strangled as I struggle to keep the tremor of fear from creeping into it.
 
Rico barks a harsh, mocking laugh. "Oh, yes, it does," he sneers. "You've never managed to beat me in a fight, Luca. Remember when we were eighteen and you took a swing at me? You were drunk, trying to impress some slut at a bar. You were trying to be the big man, saying I had insulted her. I handed your ass back to you then, and I'm not opposed to a repeat performance." His grin is a harsh slash across his face, cruel and unforgiving. "If I remember rightly, your father was more impressed with my fighting skills than your pitiful attempt to defend her so-called honor. Are you prepared to die for a girl? What makes you think tonight will be any different? "
 
"Love," I say.
 
Rico's laughter rings out again, loud and obnoxious. "Love? Is that your secret weapon? Do you think you are in some fucking rom-com?" He scoffs, shaking his head in mock disappointment.
 
"Love isn't a weapon, Rico," I reply, my voice heavy with disdain. "Not that you would understand anything about it."
 
Rico shakes his head, his expression a mix of frustration and disgust. "Don't play the saint with me, Luca," he snaps, his voice dropping to a menacing whisper. "You forget that I know the real you. This isn’t you,” his hand sweeps to indicate the cottage, “you aren’t a ‘falling in love’ kind of guy. Do you forget that I’ve seen you bang countless whores?”
 
“Fuck off, Rico. That’s not the real me, you don’t know me. It’s rich talk from a guy who can’t speak to a woman without pissing his jeans.”
 
Rico’s face flashes with anger. “Anyway, you don’t need to worry about your new little whore anymore. The old man blames Bella for everything that's happened. Did you know that he was the one who found Bianca's body? Can you imagine that? Stumbling on the rotting corpse of the woman you loved? I still don't know how he knew where to look." His words hang in the air. "We buried her in the woods," he continues, his gaze steady on mine. "Vittorio knew just the place." His voice is chillingly matter-of-fact as he speaks of the gruesome act. "He took us right to it. We bug a hole and threw her in. Can you imagine that? He hasn't been the same since." There’s a moment of silence as our eyes meet.
 
A surge of anger floods me, hot and corrosive. "And you just went along with it?" I demand, my hands curling into fists at my sides. "You just helped him cover up the murder of an innocent woman?"
 
"She was far from innocent but it's all about survival, Luca," he replies with a harsh laugh. "Unlike you, some of us don't have the luxury of lofty ideals. We do what we have to to survive." Rico meets my gaze with a hard stare, his words coming out cold and unyielding. "He blames Bella for turning your head, for leading you astray." There's a trace of bitterness in his voice. "We're not sure of all the details, but he's convinced Bella murdered Bianca. All over that damn painting. He’s sure this was Bella’s plan all along."
 
I stare at him, disbelief prickling at the edges of my rage. "That's absurd," I snap, the words tasting sour on my tongue. "Bella didn't have anything to do with it."
 
Rico shrugs a noncommittal gesture that sets my teeth on edge. "Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't really matter now, does it? Your father is about to have his revenge on your pretty little Russian whore."

His eyes shift back to the gun on the ground. I follow his gaze, the cold metal of the weapon a stark contrast against the earth.
 
"I can't believe it." I laugh, a hollow, bitter sound that echoes off the stone walls around us. "You really don't know, do you?"
 
Rico's eyes narrow. "What the hell are you talking about, Luca?"
 
“It’s all a scam, all of it.”
 
“All of what?”
 
“The whole thing.”
 
“You are not making sense, Luca.”
 
“It was a scam right from the start; the Russian mafia contact, well, he was an undercover cop. The painting? It's a fake, a good one, it had me fooled, but a fake all the same. The robbery? Staged. Every one of the people at the party was fucking filth. You’ve been had, Rico my boy; hook, line and sinker. You poor dumb fuck.”
 
“You are lying. How would you even know?”
 
“Bella.”
 
“What about Bella?”
 
“You were correct, Rico, right from the start. You smelled bacon the moment she walked into the room. How’s that for irony.”
 
“What the fuck are you talking about?”
 
“You never were the quickest. Let me spell it out. Bella is a cop, a little piggy, she’s undercover filth.”
 
Rico looked at Luca, his eyes burning with hate. “I fucking knew it. Right from the start I warned you. Well, if that’s the case then I need to get this sorted quick so I can put a bullet into that pretty face of hers before your father gets his way with her.”
 
The tranquility shatters as both of us lunge towards the gun. Our bodies collide, limbs tangling. Our breaths sound harsh and ragged in the silence, the only noise aside from the gravel crunching under us and the soft rustle of our clothes as we struggle.
 
I get a hand on the cold metal, my fingers wrapping around the handle. Rico's hands are there too, his fingertips brushing mine as we both wrestle. Our bodies roll, stones and dirt digging into my skin, leaving stinging marks that I try to ignore. It's a frantic, messy tussle, our grunts of effort echoing in the mist. 

There's a deafening bang. 

It's as though the world bursts apart at the seams, all sound consumed by the roar of the gunshot. My ears ring, the noise rebounding in my skull. Everything becomes surreal, the world reduced to a narrow focus - the harsh panting of our breaths, the warm weight of the gun in my hand. There's the warmth as a hot, sticky sensation spreads across my face, the metallic smell filling my nostrils.

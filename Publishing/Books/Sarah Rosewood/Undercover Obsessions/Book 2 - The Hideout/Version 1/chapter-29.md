## Bella
 
My breaths come in ragged gasps as I sprint across the fields. I can see the outline of the surrounding countryside etched out by the soft, diffused glow of the mist. The beauty of the countryside is still hidden at dawn but the gentle whisper of the wind through the grass, and the morning chorus of the birds singing their welcome to a new day are in surreal contrast with the danger I'm fleeing from.
 
The physical strain of my flight is starting to take its toll. My legs are screaming for rest, my breath is coming in harsh, desperate gasps, and my chest is about to explode. I glance behind me but can only see a few meters into the murk. 
 
A distant loud bang shatters the peace, its ominous echo reverberating through the still morning air. The sudden sound freezes me in my tracks, my heart hammering against my ribcage. Fear floods me, raw and primal, as the dreadful implications of that lone gunshot sink in. 

I dig in and run as fast as I can.
 
The shepherd's hut is an emblem of forgotten days, its stone and timber structure standing defiantly against the harsh elements of the Welsh countryside. I burst through the door, the worn wood protesting loudly at the sudden intrusion. I glance out of the small, weather-beaten window. The glass has long since been broken, leaving nothing more than a rotting frame. I can't see anything apart from the slowly dispersing mist.
 
I make for the back of the hut. The light is limited and it's difficult to see clearly. Feeling the rough floor beneath me, I shuffle to the corner of the hut, my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. From a crevice in the wall I retrieve the knife. It feels heavy in my hand, a strange comfort amidst the chaos. Tucking myself into the corner, I press my back against the cool stones, their rough texture grounding me. I try to quiet my breathing, each inhale and exhale sounding absurdly loud in the silence of the hut. I listen, my entire body tensed and ready for whatever may come.
 
I wait. 

Luca will be here soon. He will come for me. He promised.

The fear is palpable, a thick fog filling the small space and tightening my chest. I know I must remain hidden, must stay quiet if I want to survive. I realize I am holding my breath, counting each second. The wait is agonizing, a cruel game of suspense, but I have no choice. I have to be patient. I have to be ready. For Luca. For me. For us.
 
"Bella." A voice shatters the stillness. It carries over the windswept hills, echoing around the confines of the hut. A surge of relief courses through me. 

"Luca," I whisper, recognizing the Italian lilt. 

"Bella. Bella."

The initial surge of relief dissipates like morning fog under the heat of realization. The voice is too deep, the undertones too harsh. It isn’t Luca. My breath hitches in my chest as a cold hand of dread curls around my heart. Vittorio. His voice's deep, grating timbre was unmistakable, tainted with a menace that makes my skin crawl.

"Bella," he bellows again, his voice loud and insistent.

A fresh wave of fear crashes over me, its icy touch chilling me. Panic sets in, gnawing at my insides, but I shove it away with every ounce of resolve. I can't afford to lose control now. Not when I'm alone and my life hangs in the balance.

"I know you're in the hut," his voice booms again, closer this time. "I'm coming to get you."

My heart pounds so hard I'm afraid it might give away my hiding spot. But I stay still, gripping the knife tighter, my knuckles turning white under the strain. My mind races. I remain crouched in my corner, my wide eyes trained on the door. I wish for Luca, his comforting presence, his steady hand in mine. But all I have now is his knife and his lessons. I intend to use them both. But what did he say? He told me how I should fight. I try to recall his words but the fear pushes them away. Panic rises. 

Vittorio bursts through the door, his bulky frame throwing a sprawling shadow that seizes the modest room. He stands panting in the entrance, his shirt clinging to his back, drenched in sweat. He must have disgarded his suit jacket. Vittorio Vella, a once dashing figure in his prime, has become a testament to time's cruel games. The years of sin have sketched a vivid portrait of decay onto his face, chiseling it with deep creases, plumping it with layers of excess indulgence, and stripping the luster from his once-vibrant hair. Yet, beneath the fading charm, the intimidating visage of a ruthless criminal persists. His physical prowess may be waning, with the contours of his silhouette filled out by the excess weight of age. However, the threat he poses is undiminished. 
 
“There you are, you little fucking Russian bitch.” He smiles. “This is going to be fun. I’ve never actually hit a woman before, but I will make an exception to the rule for you.”
 
Vittorio's lumbering footsteps reverberate. I spring from my crouch, my body taut with anticipation, knife clutched in my hand.
 
"Vittorio, wait," my voice trembles. "We can both get out of this, okay? It's not too late."
 
A wry smile carves onto Vittorio's face, a grim sense of amusement tinting his words. "Those days are long gone, Bella," he retorts. “They ended when you pulled that trigger and killed Bianca.”
 
I stare at him in disbelief. “I… I… didn’t kill Bianca.” The words tumble out before I have time to think.
 
“You are a lying fucking commie bitch and you will pay.” I can see the anger flaring in his eyes. He takes another step forward.
 
“No,” I say, lifting my hand without the knife. “I am not lying.”
 
“Shut the fuck up.” His voice is now controlled. The tone is strangely horrifying. I find myself complying. "You made me bury my wife, and now you owe me. The plan is simple. I kill you, take the painting, and live happily ever after. Rico has already dealt with that shit of a son.” He smiles. "But first, I intend to take a bit of revenge for Bianca." 

His declaration throws me off balance, the enormity of what he's implying hitting me square in the chest, drawing a sharp intake of breath. The lethal determination in his voice tells me something crucial; he's utterly oblivious to the larger scheme of things. He doesn't know I'm a cop, that we've been orchestrating an elaborate sting operation, or that the painting he's risking his life for is a counterfeit.

My grip on the knife tightens, the knuckles turning bone white.

Vittorio roars. It is a guttural sound of fury and desperation. He hurtles towards me. His sizeable form moves faster than I would have thought possible. I try to sidestep, my training kicking in, but it's too late. His beefy fist slams into my face, a blossoming pain erupting in my cheekbone. His assault catches me off guard, sending me skidding across the rough floor. A cry of surprise escapes me as I lose my footing and hit the ground hard. The impact knocks the wind out of me, but through it all, my fingers remain clenched around the knife handle.

Luca's words suddenly flood into my head. 'If you have to fight, then you fight like a demon.'

I look up at Vittorio. My vision is hazy from the impact, but I see his bulky frame looming over me. There’s a glint in the dim light, sun on metal. I see Vittorio has a knife. It's small, almost like he's about to peel potatoes. My breath catches in my throat, a renewed wave of fear freezing my body and limbs.

"Bitch," he sneers, his smirk a grotesque contortion of his face. He lunges, slashing towards me.

I lift my arms to shield myself. I feel the sharp sting as the blade buries itself into my arm. With a quick yank, I pull away. The knife, slick with my blood, slips from his grasp, clattering out of sight. Pain doesn't register immediately, but then it hits, flooding my senses with a blinding white intensity. My vision wavers and bile rises in my throat. I have the sudden urge to vomit. I fight against the urge to pass out, forcing my eyes open and staying alert.
 
Vittorio towers over me, his bloated face twisted into a hideous snarl of anger and satisfaction. I force the stars out of my vision, compelling myself to stay present and conscious.

He steps forward and lands a brutal kick to my midsection, expelling the air I've been desperately trying to inhale. Sharp, stinging pain radiates from my stomach, making me double over in agony. I grunt, rolling onto my side while clutching my aching belly, attempting to breathe through the waves of pain. My eyes, watering from the pain, flick up to Vittorio. Dread gnaws at my insides as I watch him towering over me, an ugly smirk twisting his features.

“Fucking bitch,” he says. “That was for me, this is for Bianca.”

His chubby hands drop to the fly of his trousers. He begins to unzip, but his large sausage fingers, slick with my blood, struggle to grasp the small metal catch.
A hot surge of rage replaces fear in my heart. I refuse to let this be my conclusion. I refuse to let him win. With a newfound determination fueling my strength, my grip tightens around the hilt of the knife.

He grips the metal tag and there’s the soft sound of the zip unfastening. He looks up at me and smiles. “Let me show you what a real man feels like.”

The air within the shepherd's hut is thick, a toxic blend of terror, adrenaline, and the harsh metallic scent of fresh blood. 

Time seems to freeze and Vittorio looms over me. 

'Demon.'

The stifling silence of the hut shatters as I spring upwards, driven by primal desperation. My hand, wrapped around the knife's hilt, thrusts forward with an untamed fury. A terrifying moment of resistance is felt as the blade meets flesh before plunging into Vittorio's fat gut.

The scream that tears from Vittorio's throat is a horrific, echoing howl that shatters the oppressive quiet of the hut. His hands fly to his stomach, where the weapon protrudes from him. Shock and pain cause his knees to buckle, and he slumps onto the cold dirt floor, gasping for breath. His wide eyes, filled with the dawning realization of his impending death, remain locked onto me as I force my shaky legs to carry me toward the exit.

Every movement feels like I'm trying to walk underwater, each step a Herculean effort. My body aches, resonating with throbbing pain in my arm. I look to see a deep cut; I can see my exposed pink flesh and a white flash of bone; blood is pumping from the wound. My head spins. I press on. It can’t end like this. I need to survive. Luca will find me.
 
I reach the worn-out door; my fingers graze the coarse, weather-beaten wood. I allow myself a fleeting moment of respite, leaning against the frame, my breath heaving in ragged gasps. I risk a glance over my shoulder at Vittorio's body. He is still on the floor, his enormous bulk unmoving, a pool of deep red blood slowly expanding around him. 

Ripping my gaze away, I step out into the cool dawn air, the dew-soaked grass crunching underfoot. The mist has lifted, showing the tranquil countryside in an unsettling contrast to the gruesome scene I am leaving behind. But there's no time for reflection; I must keep moving, escape, survive. I push on. The world seems eerily silent, the lack of noise pressing in on me as if the earth itself is holding its breath. The chill morning air wraps around me. My heart hammers wildly in my chest. The cold seeps into my skin, but I barely register the discomfort.
 
The roar of a car engine sounds in the distance. The sound, foreign in this tranquil landscape, snaps me back to the present. The urgent beeping of a car horn follows it.
 
My survival instincts kick back in, recognizing the signal. It must be Luca. The fear that had momentarily gripped me fades, replaced by a renewed sense of urgency. 

I need to reach the car. 

I need Luca.

Ignoring the fatigue threatening to drag me down, I run. My boots squelch in the dew-soaked grass. The field before me seems endless, but I can see the faint outline of a narrow lane cutting through the hedge in the distance. The car horn blares again, echoing louder and more insistent through the crisp morning air.
 
Pushing through the exhaustion, I surge forward, each stride bringing me closer to safety. I stagger and fall. 

I hit the wet grass in an awkward heap. Pain shooting through my body. I turn and try to lift myself to my feet. It seems like all of the energy has seeped from my body. I look to see my arm and hand slick with my blood. The grass where I fell is painted red. 

For a moment, I smile. 

I let out a small chuckle. 

I think how Luca would have found the contrast of colors interesting, how he would have commented on the way the red seems more urgent and visceral, contrasting against the calmness of the green grass. 

I slump down, a wave of peace washes over my body. 

I look up from the grass to the sky. I hadn’t noticed how blue it had become, just a single white cloud. A black shape arcs above me. A crow, perhaps. Yes, a crow. It is circulating, this steady motion memorizing. I feel a calm smile form on my lips. I could stay here and watch the birds forever…

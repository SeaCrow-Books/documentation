# Chapter 6
## Luca
 
The room is steeped in darkness, a heavy silence cloaking it like a shroud. Bella lies next to me, her body rising and falling with each breath she takes in her sleep. In the dim light, I can make out the contours of her face, peaceful and beautiful. She looks so innocent, so fragile in sleep.
 
The absence of light, and the quiet should be comforting. But they're not. They're suffocating. I'm suffocating. This isn't just darkness; it's a black hole, pulling me in, stripping me of control, leaving me feeling powerless. I'm scared. More scared than I've ever admitted to myself. This isn't just about me anymore; it's about Bella too. I've pulled her into this, into my mess, and the weight of that responsibility feels like a boulder on my chest. What if I can't protect her? What if my past catches up with us?
 
I turn to my side, pulling Bella closer, her body warm against mine. She murmurs in her sleep, burrowing deeper into my arms. I lay there, holding her close, watching her sleep, and I can't help but feel lost. I hold Bella tighter. I try to sleep, my arms wrapped around Bella, I can't shake off the feeling of vulnerability that continues to gnaw at me.
 
I slip out of the bed, careful not to disturb Bella. I reach out, my fingers closing around the cool, metallic surface of the torch. The other hand finds the gun, its familiar weight. The gun had been hidden but after Iwan, I moved it to the bedside table. I could tell Bella wasn’t impressed but she didn’t say anything. 

I walk to the kitchen and pull on my coat. The darkened room feels oppressive. Turning the knob, I step outside. The night greets me, the darkness stretching out into infinity, punctuated only by the faint glow of the stars. The chill of the Welsh night cuts through me; a shiver ripples down my spine.
 
I click on the torch, a shaft of light slicing through the obscurity, casting long shadows that dance and quiver with my movements. I scan the cottage with the beam. I am not sure what I am looking for. The slate-built structure looms like an ancient guardian in the torchlight. I tread carefully. The flashlight sweeps the darkness away, banishing it to the far corners. I follow the perimeter of the small house, following the path of the wall and soon finish my round, each step taking me back towards the cottage. Back to Bella. The small haven of light and warmth amid this cold, indifferent night. As I step inside, the door closing behind me, I feel a pang of relief. Padding back into the cottage, my feet are noiseless against the cold tiles. The door creaks shut behind me. The house is a cocoon of silence. I head to the bedroom. Inside, the only sound is Bella's soft, steady breathing. My heart tightens at the sight of her, lying peaceful and oblivious to the darkness that threatens to engulf us.
 
I nudge her awake, her eyes fluttering open with surprise and concern. "Luca?" she mumbles, her voice groggy with sleep, "What's happening?"
 
"Nothing right now," I assure her, my voice low and soothing. "I just need to show you something."
 
Bella sits up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. I place the gun on the bed. Her eyes widen at the sight, and I can see the hesitation and fear creeping into her gaze.
 
"It's for protection, Bella," I say, my words a mere whisper in the silent room. “You need to know how to use it.”
 
“No…” she says.
 
“I am not arguing.”

"Must we do this now?" she asks.

"Yes, its important. First," I say, my voice steady and calm, "you need to load it." I retrieve a magazine from a box and push the rounds into it, one by one. The motions are familiar, almost automatic, born of years of practice. "Once it's full, it slots into the base of the grip, like so." I demonstrate the action.
 
Bella's gaze is focused on the weapon as she mirrors my movements. She fumbles, her fingers unaccustomed to the feel of the cold, hard rounds, but she keeps at it until the magazine is fully loaded.
 
"Good girl," I murmur, my gaze never leaving her hands. "Now, you need to chamber a round." I demonstrate the action, pulling back the slide and letting it snap forward. The sound is sharp in the quiet room, a stark reminder of the danger we face.
 
Bella copies me; her movements are hesitant and awkward. The strength required to pull back the slide takes her by surprise, but she manages it with a look of accomplishment.
 
"The gun is now ready to fire," I say, my voice low but serious. "But before you do anything, you need to disengage the safety. See this here?" I point to a small lever on the side of the gun. "That's the safety. Push it down to fire, up to lock it."
 
Bella nods, her fingers tracing the lever, committing its position to memory. "And to fire?" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper.
 
I guide her hand to the trigger. "You pull this. But remember, Bella, only aim at something you intend to shoot. And only shoot if your life depends on it. If you must fire, try to calm yourself in that moment and squeeze the trigger."
 
She nods again, taking a deep breath as she grips the gun. The weight of it, and everything it represents, is palpable. "I understand, Luca."
 
I nod, feeling a wave of relief. "Good. Remember, if something happens the goal is to escape, not to fight. The gun is for your protection. It will buy you time. That might be all you have. If the worst happens, then you run and get away from here."
 
The room is silent, save for our quiet breaths.
 
I glance over at Bella, a new concern gnawing at the back of my mind. "If you have to, can you fight, Bella?" I ask. She nods, a small but determined smile playing on her lips. "I mean really fight."

"Yes," her voice is steady. "My father taught me." She pauses, as if thinking. "Well, not my father exactly. I've had bodyguards since I was young. Always there, in the background. Days for them would be long and boring. As I grew older, they would often pass the time teaching me moves.”  She smiles. “It became a kind of game for them. A point of pride. They used to joke that I could get a job as a bodyguard. They ensured I knew how to take care of myself."
 
A wave of relief washes over me at her words. I give her a nod of approval. "Good," I murmur, my eyes meeting hers. "That's good, Bella." I take a deep breath. "Bella," I say, the weight of the situation heavy in my voice. "We're not safe here. Not anymore." Her face pales at my words. "We need to leave, get out of this place. As soon as we can. Its time to move"
 
Her gaze doesn't waver from mine. She swallows. "Where will we go, Luca?"
 
I pause, running a hand through my hair as I consider our options. "France," I decide, the words sounding more confident than I feel. "It the logical choice, we just need to get over the Channel. We can make a life there. Start fresh."
 
Her eyes fill with a mixture of fear and hope. "But we have no money, you said so."
 
"I'll sort it out," I assure her, hoping my voice doesn't betray my uncertainty. "I'll arrange to sell the painting. We'll get fake passports. We'll make a dash for France."

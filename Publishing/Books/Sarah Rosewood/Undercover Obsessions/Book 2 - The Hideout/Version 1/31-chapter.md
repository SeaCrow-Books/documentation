# Chapter 31
## Bella
 
Consciousness comes back to me in a slow trickle. 

As my eyelids flutter open. I find myself staring up at a sterile white ceiling punctuated by fluorescent lights that are mercifully dimmed. The sharp tang of antiseptics permeates the air, a clinical scent that feels unnatural. The smell is familiar, a grim reminder of other times I've woken up in a similar state. Turning my head, my gaze travels over the room, taking in the details. It's a standard hospital room, its aesthetic favoring functionality over comfort. The room is small but not claustrophobic, painted in calming shades of pale green and white. A small window on my right lets in a sliver of sunlight, the thin curtain doing little to hinder its warm glow. The sky outside is a perfect canvas of blue. To my left, a small bedside table stands bearing a plastic pitcher of water and a single disposable cup. A flat-screen television hangs on the far wall, currently turned off. It’s a portal to the outside world that I'm not yet ready to venture into. Beneath it, a small, closed-door hints at a private bathroom. A lonely chair sits in the corner, its worn upholstery a testament to countless worried sitters in the past. The room's door stands open, giving me a narrow view of the hospital corridor. A uniformed police officer is planted outside my room, sitting on a folding chair. His hat rests on his knee, revealing a head of closely cropped hair.
 
I glance down at my arm, finding it peppered with IV lines, disappearing into a bandage that wraps around my forearm. I flex my fingers, wincing as a dull ache throbs in time with my heartbeat. 

I close my eyes and drift back to sleep.
 
The sound of footsteps echoing on the linoleum floor wakes me. A tall figure steps into the room, immediately commanding the space. Superintendent Harrison. He carries an air of weary gentleness around him. His broad shoulders sag slightly as if burdened by a thousand unsolved cases, and his usually piercing eyes look dull and tired. Yet, his appearance doesn't diminish his aura of authority, instead, it lends him a relatable quality. He's dressed in his usual well-tailored suit, but his tie is loose around his neck, his jacket is discarded, and his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His salt-and-pepper hair is more disheveled than I've seen it before, sbut it still gives him a distinguished look. His gaze lands on me and a smile tugs at the corners of his lips, transforming his otherwise serious expression. The smile doesn't quite reach his eyes. For a moment, as he stands there, offering a warm smile despite his apparent exhaustion, I feel a sudden surge of gratitude towards the man. Despite everything, Harrison is here, ready to face whatever comes next with me.

I return his smile. A wave of emotion washes over me, a torrent of fear, relief, and exhaustion that leaves me trembling. At that moment, I feel so small, so vulnerable. I look up at Harrison, his presence solid and comforting in this sterile hospital room, and I can't help but voice the thought tugging at the edges of my mind.
 
"Can I... Can I have a hug?" I ask the words barely above a whisper.
 
A moment of surprise flashes in his eyes, quickly replaced by understanding. He steps closer, leaning in to wrap his arms around me. The scent of his aftershave fills my nostrils, a comforting blend of sandalwood and something sharper, citrus, maybe. It's distinctly him. I bury my face in his chest, the soft fabric of his shirt soaking up the tears that escape my eyes. His embrace is firm, grounding, a silent promise of protection. I lose myself in it, allowing the pent-up fear and relief to spill out in quiet sobs. After what feels like an eternity, he pulls back, his hands on my shoulders as he studies my face. A tear trails down his cheek, shining in the sterile light of the hospital room.
 
"I'm glad you're safe." His voice is choked with emotion.
 
I manage a weak smile, my hand wiping away the tear on his cheek. "Me too," I say, my voice hoarse from crying. "Me too."
 
Harrison takes a step back. “How are you feeling?”
 
“I am ok, considering.”
 
“That’s good.”
 
There’s a moment of awkward silence. “Tell me what happened,” I say.
 
“Are you sure you are up to it?”
 
“Yes, everything. Is Luca ok? How did you find us?”
 
Harrison takes a breath. "Well, after the robbery, we lost you. We tracked Luca’s car with PNC but lost him in the Welsh mountains. It seems he had thought of everything. We suspected you were hiding out, but we were not sure.”
 
“We were at the cottage.”
 
“Anyway, when you rang, we traced the number and worked out where you were. You asked us not to move, and I pulled a few strings to give you time. However, we did decide to start tracking Vittorio twenty-four-seven. We were watching him anyway, but he had been quiet as a mouse. So when he started to head towards Wales, we suspected something was about to happen.” He ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. "We mobilized our forces. We... we were a little slow," he admits, a hint of frustration coloring his voice. “I had to get clearance to use the armed officers. My superiors were a bit jumpy, but in the end, they agreed. It cost us a few hours.”
 
I let out a little ironic chuckle. “Yeah, could have done with you a few hours sooner.”
 
"I am sorry,” Harrison says. “We only showed up as you and Luca were making a run for it," he continues. "We arrived just in time to see you two speed off, and we immediately set up a block at the main road. We picked up Luca and got you to the hospital but we didn't know if Vittorio was with you or still in the cottage, so we had to secure the area and proceed cautiously."
 
My voice, barely a whisper in the sterile silence of the room, manages to form the question that's been nagging at the corners of my mind. "What about Rico?"
 
The change in Harrison's demeanor is immediate, as if a shadow has passed over him, dimming the light in his green eyes. He seems to age at that moment, the lines of his face deepening. "Rico..." he starts. "Rico's not doing well. He’s in a bad way. Luca shot him in the face. He's in hospital, but the doctors don't think he'll survive long."
 
"And Vittorio? Did you find his body?" The name leaves a bitter taste on my tongue.
 
The silence lingers, a palpable entity in the room. The superintendent’s eyes meet mine, his gaze unreadable. He seems surprised. "Body? There's no sign of Vittorio."
 
"Wait? What? That... That can't be," I protest, shaking my head as I try to reconcile his words with the violent images seared into my memory. "He was... I left him... He was dead. On the floor of the hut." The image of his body surrounded by a pool of blood flashes into my mind. 
 
Harrison holds up his hand, stalling my frantic words. "We searched the hut, Bella," he states, each word measured. "We found blood, lots of it. But Vittorio wasn't there."
 
"I... I don't understand," I stammer, trembling with disbelief and fear. The stark, sterile walls of the hospital room seem to close in around me, the persistent beep of the heart monitor becoming a deafening drone. "I stabbed him, I buried the knife in his guts. He couldn't have... he shouldn't have... He couldn't have gotten far."
 
Harrison regards me, his eyes flickering with an unreadable emotion. He sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. His voice is matter-of-fact when he speaks, but I detect a trace of uncertainty beneath his professional demeanor. "We haven't found him yet, Bella," he admits, his gaze not wavering from mine. "Given the amount of blood at the scene, he probably didn't get far. We checked the area but it rained hard just after we picked you up.” He pauses. “Most likely crawled off into some ditch to die. It'll be some poor farmer who stumbles upon his remains in a few days, no doubt."
 
Silence stretches between us, filling the room with its oppressive weight. I stare at the crisp, white sheets of the hospital bed, my mind whirling with the enormity of everything that's happened.
 
“And Luca?”
 
“Don’t worry about Luca, he’s safe.”
 
"No," I say, my voice louder than I'd intended. "I want to know what happened to Luca." Harrison blinks at me, clearly taken aback by the intensity of my response. But I don't care. "I've put everything on the line for that man," I continue, my words spilling out in a rush. "I've risked my life, for him and the job. For you. I have every right to know what will happen to him." My heart pounds as I meet Harrison's gaze head-on. I see a flash of something in his eyes— surprise, perhaps, or maybe even respect. But it's gone as quickly as it came, replaced by the cool, unreadable mask he always wears. There's a long silence where he studies me, his gaze intense and unwavering. I refuse to back down, to look away. “I won't be dismissed. Not now. Not after everything I've been through.”
 
"Alright, Bella," he says. "We'll talk about Luca." Harrison takes a moment, adjusting his stance before he speaks again. "Luca is currently safe. He hasn't been arrested, yet. But that might change, depending on..."
 
I frown at him, my impatience rising. "Depends on what?" 

He meets my gaze. "Well, assuming Vittorio is still out there, Luca has some difficult choices to make.”

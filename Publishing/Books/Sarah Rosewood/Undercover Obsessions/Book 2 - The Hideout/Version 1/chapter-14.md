## Luca
 
The warm glow of candlelight bathes the kitchen. I hold a mug, its edges worn and chipped. It's brimming with whiskey. It's late, and the house has slipped into a slumber. Bella is asleep. I rose from the warmth of the bed when she fell asleep, a restlessness gnawing at me, refusing to let me sleep.
 
Now, I find myself anchored in the unsteady halo of the lamp, losing myself in the burn of the whiskey, its bitter tang searing my throat. The mug feels cold against my hand, the ceramic indifferent to my inner turmoil. My thoughts are a swirling storm, each more turbulent than the last, and I gulp down another mouthful, letting the liquor blunt the edges of my panic.
 
I'm drunk, and maybe that's for the best. 

I rake a hand through my hair, tugging at the strands in frustration. It's all spiraling out of control, my carefully laid plans unraveling. The painting was supposed to be our way out, a lifeline amidst the chaos. But with Charlie Foster refusing to talk and the police car in the village, everything feels uncertain. I'm fighting to keep us safe, to protect Bella, and yet, it feels like I'm sinking, my efforts futile against the tide that threatens to engulf us.
 
I take another swig, the harsh whiskey blurring the edges of my consciousness. The room wavers before me, the darkness encroaching, the lamplight becoming a distant beacon. My head feels heavy, my thoughts a jumbled mess of fear and desperation.
 
The burner phone lies on the table beside me; the black book splayed open beside it. My fingers trace over the keys of the phone. I reach for the mug, the liquor seeming more inviting than the cold touch of the phone. I'd rather drown in the numb oblivion it promises than face the inevitable.
 
The painting. 

It's my one hope, my one chance to fix this mess. It's currently safe and hidden away, buried behind the house. I'd stashed it there the day we arrived, tucking it safely beneath the earth and the protective cover of sprouting nettles. It's there, within reach, but utterly useless. I need to sell it, turn it into the salvation we need, the funds to secure our passports and freedom. But who would buy it? I have no contacts anymore and no trustworthy middleman to broker the deal. I'm an outcast, a pariah in a world that once considered me an ally. I'm toxic, a marked man. I can't blame anyone for keeping their distance. I'm a liability, a ticking time bomb with an uncertain fuse.
 
The room swims around me as I down more whiskey, the strong liquid burning down my throat. I clutch the mug tighter, my mind a whirlpool of hopelessness and desperation. I need someone to trust and help me navigate this storm.
 
Rico.
 
My mind latches onto the thought. Rico has always been loyal and always been there when I needed him. We've been through thick and thin, side by side. He's more than a friend; he's my brother in all but blood.
 
Rico... yes, if anyone would risk everything to help me, it would be him.
 
Excitement and a sense of hope spark within me, battling the foggy shroud of the whiskey. I sit for a moment, letting the idea solidify and become real.
 
But then, the harsh reality crashes back in.
 
I would be asking Rico to betray my father, the one man he has always been loyal to.
 
Would he risk everything for me? After all, he has his own life to protect. Why would he jeopardize that for me? Plus, how would he sell the painting? 

No, Rico will not work.

I take another swig, letting the burning liquid slip down my throat. 
 
Unless… 

I smile. Yes. The thought becomes clear through the haze of the whiskey. 

Fuck. I’ve been thinking about this the wrong way.
 
I don’t need to sell the painting; I just need to get out of the country.

I stare at the black book. I take a deep breath and reach for the burner phone, its weight heavy in my trembling hands. I flip through the book, my fingers running down the list of numbers until they rest on Rico's. With a deep breath, I punch in the numbers and bring the phone to my ear. The phone starts to ring.
 
The familiar gruff voice on the other end of the line sounds groggy, roused from sleep. "Yeah, who is this?" Rico mutters, confusion tingeing his words. “This better be fucking important.”
 
"It's Luca," I say, my voice barely above a whisper.
 
There's a pause. Rico's voice comes back, sharper now, alert. "Fucking hell, Luca. Do you have a death wish? We can't be having this conversation."
 
I close my eyes, feeling a sharp sting of pain at the words. I knew this was a risk, but hearing the confirmation makes it all the more real. "I know, Rico," I murmur. "But I need your help."
 
Silence stretches over the line, longer this time. 

"Please Rico. Don't make me beg."

I can practically hear Rico's mind, weighing the risks and benefits. “Fuck me, Luca.” A pause. The room is silent. I get up and turn on the light. The bare lightbulb pierces the darkness. The sound of the generator starting seems suddenly loud. “You ok?” His voice is careful and guarded.
 
“Yeah,” I say.
 
“Where are you?”
 
“You know I can’t tell you that.”
 
There’s a pause, the hum of the generator the only sound. “You safe?”
 
“Yeah.”
 
“Bella with you?”
 
“Yeah.”
 
"Ok. I'll listen, Luca. For old times' sake. I owe you that. But that's all I owe you."
 
“Thank you.” Relief floods my body.

"What do you need?" he asks.
 
"Rico," I start, my voice thick with desperation. "I need two fake passports. Me and a Bella... we need to leave the country."
 
There's a sharp intake of breath from the other side of the line. "Fuck, Luca, you know how risky that is..."
 
"I know, Rico. I know," I interrupt. "But I'm out of options. I can't access my bank accounts. I've got enough cash to get us out of the country. Once I am safe, I can access my offshore stash. But for now, I'm cornered."
 
There's another drawn-out silence. I know Rico's calculating. Assessing whether my situation is worth risking his neck for. I wait. I understand he needs time to process. I throw in one last card, the only one left. "There's some cash... in the basement of the house," I tell him. "There’s enough for the passports and a big chunk left over. It's yours if you can help me out."
 
“You talking about the emergency cash behind the filing cabinet?”
 
“Yeah.”
 
There’s more silence. “Ok. If, and it's a big if, I am going to do this, it will take a few days. I will need to know where you are.”
 
“I’ll tell you that when the passports are ready.”
 
“You don't trust me?”
 
It's a good question. Do I trust him? Really? “I don’t have a choice, Rico.”
 
I hear a long intake of breath. “Right, let me think about it; ring me tomorrow, and I’ll tell you what’s happening.”
 
I go to answer, but Rico has already hung up the phone.
 
I take the bottle of whiskey and tip a generous measure into my mug.

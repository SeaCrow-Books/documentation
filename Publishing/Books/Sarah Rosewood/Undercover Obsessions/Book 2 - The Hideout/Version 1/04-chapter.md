# Chapter 4
## Luca
 
I am woken by the rhythm of rain dancing on the cottage roof. It is cold, the kind of cold that seeps into your bones and lingers there. The early morning sun is creeping through the small window. I pull Bella closer, seeking warmth in the curve of her body against mine. She stirs, a soft sigh escaping her lips before she snuggles in, finding solace in our tangled limbs and shared body heat. I find myself tracing the contours of her face with my fingertips, lingering on the shadows under her closed eyes, the slope of her nose, the curve of her lips. 
 
The soothing symphony of the early morning rain splattering against the slate roof is drowned out by a new, alien sound - the guttural roar of a car engine. I jolt into alertness, my heart pounding. We have been at the cottage for a few weeks and not once have I seen a car on the narrow lane. I leap from the bed, the sheet falling away, my bare feet hitting the cold floor with a light thud. Bella stirs, blinking at my abrupt movement. 

"Luca, what...?" The question dies in her throat as she sees the apprehension in my face. Her deep hazel eyes widen, a mirror of my fear.
 
"Quiet," I whisper, a single finger pressed to my lips.
 
I cross the small room and edge the tattered curtain aside just enough to peer out. Through the weather-beaten window, veiled by droplets of rain, the outside world is a blurry tableau of dark shadows. Squinting, I try to discern any sign of the intrusive vehicle. The roaring engine grows louder, creeping closer.
 
"Hide, Bella. Now." My voice is hushed but harsh. Her wide eyes stare at me. I bend down and thrust my hand, unseen, under the bed. I grasp for a moment before my fingers touch cold metal. I pull out the handgun, the cold steel a familiar weight in my hand.
 
I make my way to the kitchen. I pull on my boots over my bare feet. I step to the door, push the bolt back and grab the handle. My heart thumps as I fling the door open, bracing myself for whatever lies outside. I step out into the drizzling rain, the icy droplets mingling with the sweat that beads on my forehead. My hand and the gun hang loose at my side. My grip on the gun tightens as I spot a dark green Land Rover. Its wheels and body work is caked in mud. It has pulled to a halt on the lane outside the house. The low, waist high stone wall, which surrounds the house, is the only protection. I look to the right and see my car still parked on the muddy grass verge next to the wall. 
 
I look back as the door of the Land Rover swings open. The sight that greets me is both comforting and unsettling. Out steps a man, whom the Welsh landscape has claimed as its own, a man as much a part of this land as the rolling hills and deep valleys. I recognize him as Iwan Jones. In his sixties, Iwan is the embodiment of the steadfast Welsh sheep farmer. His imposing figure, standing tall at six feet, is as familiar to me. His hair, once a rich chestnut, now mirrors the grizzled coat of his grazing sheep, speckled generously with grey. The deep-set eyes under his furrowed brows reflect the hues of the tumultuous Welsh skies. Iwan's hands are like maps etched with tales of struggle and perseverance. Surprise registers on his weathered face as he spots me. I push the gun into the small of my back, securing it in the belt of my trousers. 
 
"Iwan," I call out. He squints in my direction, his weathered hand shading his eyes from the sparse morning light and persistent drizzle.
 
"Luca?" he responds. "What are you doing here this time of year?" His voice is gruff and perplexed, echoing off the damp stone walls of the cottage. He steps forward, standing next to the wall, but not moving to open the small, worn wooden gate.
 
"I um…, just thought I'd take a break, you know? Been meaning to spend some more time painting."

Iwan's bushy brows furrow. "Painting, huh?" He scratches his head. "Well, I suppose that makes sense. I was out on the back fields last night. Some stupid ewe had gotten herself tangled in a fence. I saw the light in the cottage. Ain't used to seeing that. Thought I'd better check."
 
His words hang heavy in the crisp morning air, and my pulse quickens. I force a chuckle, trying to ease the tension. "I suppose I should've let the neighbors know. Didn't mean to spook anyone."
 
Iwan takes my words in stride, a slow nod coming after a thoughtful pause. He seems to be mulling over his next words. "Just...didn't expect anyone up here this time of year. Especially you." His eyes hold mine, their icy blue depth filled with unvoiced questions.
 
"I've always been one for surprises, haven't I, Iwan?" I respond, hoping my smile doesn't look as strained as it feels. The following silence is palpable. "I've always wanted to capture the light here during this time of year. The valley shines so differently. The nuances of this season... It's just something else entirely."
 
Iwan nods. "Aye, the light has a unique glow, but while you chase the light, I have my hands full with the sheep." He chuckles, the sound echoing in the vastness of the valley. "In the colder months, we're busy shearing the sheep before the harshest cold hits, ensuring they have enough feed, especially when the grass is covered in frost or snow. We must also be vigilant about their health, watching for any signs of distress and providing them shelter from the brutal winter winds."
 
We fall into silence. The cold morning air swirls around us.
 
"You remember when I first brought my sketchbook out here, Iwan?" I say, a smile playing on my lips. "I thought I'd never seen colors as vivid, light as magical as I did here in Snowdonia."
 
Iwan chuckles at this, his eyes twinkling with unspoken memories. "I remember, lad. You were always with your nose in that sketchbook of yours.”
 
I laugh, the sound echoing around the isolated hills around us. "But I was seeing, Iwan. I was seeing the way the sun hits the peaks in the morning, the way the shadows lengthen as evening falls, the myriad of colors hidden in a single blade of grass. This place... It's a paradise for a painter. Do you know that in the 1850s painters used to travel here to capture the light? It was a whole thing."

"I never knew that."

"Yeah," I say. "A thing."

His eyes soften at this and silence falls on us again. After a moment that seems to stretch into infinity, filled with unsaid thoughts and unasked questions, Iwan breaks the silence. "I best be on my way," he announces, his tone steady but not without a hint of reluctance.
 
His gaze meets mine, and for a moment, I see a flicker of curiosity dancing in his deep-set eyes. I hold my breath as he steps forward, extending his calloused hand towards me. I accept the gesture, our hands clasping together across the wall in a firm shake. I watch Iwan climb back into his Landrover, his silhouette backlit by the morning sun. The car comes to life with a familiar rumble, and I find myself holding my breath as I watch it slowly roll away, its path veiled by the morning mist.
 
The sound of the Landrover's engine fades into the backdrop of bird calls and rustling leaves, leaving behind an echoing silence. I stand in the quiet of the morning until the landscape swallows the last traces of Iwan. Only then do I allow myself to breathe, my pulse beginning to slow as I head back into the cottage. 

The door creaks as I push it open. I shut the door behind me, the chill of the morning still clings to my skin, mirroring the cold realization that's beginning to take hold. I remove the gun and hide it in a drawer in the kitchen.
 
I sink onto the worn-out couch in the corner of the kitchen, my heart still hammering against my ribs. Iwan's visit, however benign it may have been, had pulled the rug from under my feet. The cottage's walls suddenly seem too thin, the isolation not secluded enough. I close my eyes, pressing the heels of my hands into them until I see sparks of light dancing in the darkness. 

Images flash through my mind - the barrel of a gun pointed at Bella, the life I dreamed of disappearing before it even had a chance to begin. 
 
I shake my head, forcing the horrific images away.
 
I hear a shuffle of feet and turn to find Bella peeking out from the bedroom doorway, worry etched across her face. 

"Who was it, Luca?" she asks, her voice barely above a whisper. Her eyes flick to the door and then back to me.
 
"It was Iwan," I respond, attempting to keep my voice steady. I force a smile onto my face. "Our neighbor from the next farm."
 
The tension in Bella's shoulders eases. "Iwan," she repeats, a soft sigh escaping her lips. "That's good, right? He's a friend?"
 
I nod. "He's a sheep farmer. We're okay, Bella. We're still safe. We're okay," I say, pulling her into my arms. The weight of her against me, the warmth of her body, brings a sense of comfort. 
 
Her eyes study me, filled with a mix of concern and affection. I lean in and brush my lips against hers, a soft, lingering kiss that promises safety and love.
 
"Are you okay?" Bella asks as we break apart, her fingers tracing the worry lines on my forehead.
 
"I am," I admit, allowing a vulnerable honesty to lace my words. "Just a little shaken."
 
Her brows furrow, confusion dancing in her eyes. "But Iwan... he's a friend, right? We can trust him?"
 
"Yes, he is, and yes, we can trust him," I reassure her, my thumb tracing the curve of her cheek to soothe her worry. "But that's not the point. He could have been anyone, Bella."
 
Her eyes widen, the weight of my words sinking in. "You thought...?"
 
"Yeah," I admit, my heart pounding in my chest as I recall the split-second of terror that coursed through me. "For a moment, I thought we'd been found." The room falls silent, the words hanging heavy in the air. "Bella," I say. "We need a plan."
 
"A plan?" Her brow furrows, a question in her eyes.
 
"Yes," I say, my grip on her hand tightening. "We've been too careless. We've taken too many risks." I can see her wanting to protest, but I press on before she can. "We can't just hope that no one finds us. We can't rely on luck. We can't live in a fantasy. We need a real plan. Bella, we need to start thinking practically about all this. Our escape to France... It's been a beautiful dream. But to turn that dream into a reality, we need to start considering the logistics." Her eyes flit with confusion, not quite following my abrupt shift in tone. I squeeze her hand, urging her to understand. "Look, we've been living off the grid, off the radar. But now we're discussing crossing borders and settling in a new place. That requires documents, passports, and money. Money that I can't access without revealing our location."
 
I pause. Her hand trembles in mine, uncertainty radiating from her.
 
"But...but how do we get that money, Luca?" Her voice is small, almost a whisper.
 
I take a deep breath, steeling myself for what I'm about to propose. "We sell the painting, Bella." I blurt out, the words hanging heavy in the air between us.
 
Her eyes widen, surprise etching her features. "The painting?"
 
"Yes," I nod. "It's our way out of here. Our ticket to safety. It’s our chance at a new life.”

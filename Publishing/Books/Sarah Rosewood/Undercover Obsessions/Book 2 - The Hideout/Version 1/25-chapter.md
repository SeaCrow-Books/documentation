# Chapter 25
## Bella
 
The worn kitchen table sits between us, the rolled painting a reminder of the devastating truth, an open wound. Remnants of our earlier turmoil lie strewn across the floor, shards of ceramic scattered like broken promises. The silence is thick, wrapping around us like a suffocating blanket.
 
"I've failed you," Luca's voice breaks the stillness, a soft murmur barely rising above the quiet hum of the generator. His gaze is locked on the tabletop as if seeking solace in its scarred and weathered surface. "I'm going to get us killed."
 
I watch him, the raw vulnerability etched on his features pulling at my heart. I reach across the table, resting my hand on his clenched fist. "It's not your fault, Luca," I tell him. My voice is steady, the words echoing my belief. "You didn't know it was a fake. Your plan was solid, given what you knew."
 
Minutes pass in silence.

It's as if time has frozen, holding its breath with us in this pivotal moment. We sit, lost in our thoughts, seeking answers where there seem to be none. 

"How were you going to pay Rico for the passports?" I ask, breaking the tense silence that had settled between us.
 
Luca looks up from the table, his eyes meeting mine. "I had cash hidden at the house. It was supposed to be for emergencies. Rico knew that," he explains. “He helped me collect and hide it.”
 
"So, we don't need the painting for the passports?" I reason out loud, the glimmer of a new hope igniting within me.
 
"Yes," Luca says. “I planned to get the passports and run for the border. I have enough cash to get us to France and rent a place for a few months. I have some money stashed in an offshore account. I would get that somehow; it would have given us enough time until I could find someone to buy the painting. Then we would have enough to disappear for real.”
 
"And how much cash are we talking about?" I question, my heart pounding in my chest.
 
"Twenty grand," Luca responds, "completely untraceable."
 
"That would be enough," I breathe, relief washing over me. "Enough to start a new life in France. We don’t need the painting. I could get a job teaching English or something. You could sell some of your work. It wouldn’t be much, but it would be enough to start."
 
Luca's face lights up at this, a genuine smile spreading across his face for the first time since the revelation. "Yes," he agrees, his voice filled with a renewed vigor. "You are right, we don't need the painting." He looks away and I can see him thinking. He smiles and looks at me. "Would you still love a penniless painter?"
 
I laugh, my heart fluttering in my chest. "Maybe you're the next Van Gogh," I say. "And I'll be happy as long as I'm with you."
 
Luca's eyes shine at my words, his demeanor changing. The slump in his shoulders lessens, and his head lifts a bit higher. "You're right," he says, determination edging his voice. "If we can get out of the country, we can build a new life."
 
We look at each other, really look at each other, our smiles mirroring one another. The sense of unity, of understanding, is tangible between us.
 
"Rico will be here in the morning. He has the passports," Luca says. "We need to pack and be ready to go. The second he hands over those passports, we must be in the car, ready to hit the road."

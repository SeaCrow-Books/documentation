# Chapter 9
## Bella
 
Stepping into the cottage, I'm momentarily enveloped in a heavy stillness. I glance back to see Luca still outside. There's a certain tension to his posture, unrest that stirs unease within me. I put the bread on the wooden countertop. With no fridge, the milk won't last more than a day, but it's a fact of our simple existence that I've come to accept.
 
The door creaks open, and I turn to find Luca standing in the doorway, an almost spectral figure against the light streaming in from outside. There's a certain roughness to his appearance today. His hair, usually neatly combed back, is a tousled mess as if he's been running his fingers through it repeatedly. His shirt hangs open, revealing a white undershirt, and his clean jeans are more crumpled than usual. His usually vibrant eyes seem cloudy, darting around the room as if searching for something elusive. His hands, usually so steady and controlled, keep rubbing at his face in a restless motion, mirroring the disquiet that I sense is coursing through him.
 
"Luca," I say.
 
There's a heavy sigh from him, and he steps further into the house, the door clicking shut behind him. The sense of disquiet only grows stronger, adding another layer to the thick silence in the air. The quiet of the house amplifies every sound: the soft padding of his steps, the faint rustling of his clothes, the almost imperceptible sigh that slips from him. He paces the room like a caged animal, each stride taut with an agitation that's unlike him. 
 
He stops his pacing and turns to me. "Bella," he begins, his voice thick, "I want you."
 
I hesitate. I take a step back, drawing a deep breath. "Luca," I say, "Maybe we should talk instead." My voice is steady despite the flutter of uncertainty in my chest.
 
“It wasn’t a question, we fuck. And it’s sir, remember?”
 
Luca reaches out his hand, and his fingers, strong and assertive, wrap around mine, pulling me with purpose. I glance up at him, searching his face, trying to decipher the thoughts swirling in his intense eyes. As we approach the bedroom, a multitude of emotions flood through me. The soft glow from the bedside lamp paints the room in a muted golden hue, casting shadows that dance and shift with our movements. He pauses at the bedroom threshold, turning to face me. I search his eyes again, willing them to reveal his intentions. For a moment, we're locked in this dance of uncertainty. The weight of our shared history and the current tensions hangs thick between us. 
 
“Undress and get on the bed,” Luca says, his voice is stern, his eyes fixed on mine.
 
The authority in his voice, something I've come to recognize and respond to, sends a shiver down my spine. There's an edge to it, the same harshness from the previous time. I pause, my eyes darting from him to the bed, as I process his demand. He waits, patient but unwavering, watching me with an intensity that I can't quite decipher. Swallowing hard, I begin to unbutton my blouse, my fingers trembling with a mix of anticipation and unease. As the fabric falls away, I can feel the cool air against my skin, making me even more aware of my vulnerability. I shiver as I slide my skirt down. I step out of it, leaving me in just my underwear. A brief glance at Luca tells me he expects more. Taking a deep breath, I reach behind me to unclasp my bra, letting it fall to the floor. I slip out of my panties, feeling the room's coolness envelop me.
 
I am entirely exposed, my skin tingling with a blend of nerves and anticipation. I move to the bed. Lying down, I can feel the rough sheets beneath me, contrasting with the unease coiling in my stomach. I keep my eyes on Luca, searching for any sign of the tenderness I once knew.
 
The chill in the room seems to settle deeper into my bones as Luca steps away from me. I hear the rustling of bags and try to crane my neck, attempting to glimpse what he's doing. My heart beats a rapid staccato, its rhythm echoing the confusion that clouds my mind. He returns into view. I see he is carrying four coils of rough-hewn rope, their raw edges suggesting they've been hastily cut. I take a sharp intake of breath. A million thoughts race through my head as I try to make sense of this. When had he planned this? What exactly did he intend to do? 
 
His eyes lock onto mine.
 
"Luca, what are you planning?" My voice barely rises above a whisper, the words shaky.
 
“Silence.” His voice is sharp.
 
Luca steps to the base of the bed.
 
“Open your legs.”
 
I do as he says, spreadeagling my legs. He grabs my left ankle. My breath catches. I look at him but he doesn't meet my eyes. The touch of the rope against my skin is jarring, cold and coarse. Luca loops the rope around my ankle. Every movement he makes is deliberate. I can feel the strength in his hands, the firmness with which he ties the knot. His movements are rough, but an underlying carefulness ensures he doesn't hurt me. The other end of the rope is secured to the leg of the bed, pulling taut with a final tug. I try to move my foot, testing the restraint. Panic bubbles up as I find the knot unyielding, my ankle held in place. My heart thunders in my ears, a cacophony of fear and confusion. The realization that I can't move sends a spike of anxiety coursing through me. I have to take several deep, shaky breaths, fighting the rising tide of panic and trying to steady my racing heart.
 
Luca shifts his attention to my other leg, his movements fluid and methodical. I can't help but watch him, my pulse quickening further as he takes another coil of rope into his hands. There's a charged silence between us, the only sound being the slight rustle of the rope and the hammering of my heart. As he loops the rope around my right ankle, the cool fibers dig into my skin, a stark reminder of my growing vulnerability. The knot is tight, just like the other. He secures the end to the bed, rendering me more immobile with every passing second. The bed beneath me suddenly feels vast, cold, and unfamiliar, even though I've lain in it countless times before.
 
Panic laces the edges of my thoughts. I've trusted him with restraint in the past, but this feels different — more deliberate, more intense. I swallow hard, the dryness of my throat making it difficult. 

"Luca?" My voice is barely above a whisper, a quiver of uncertainty betraying my attempts at composure. I await an answer, some kind of reassurance, but he remains engrossed in his task, leaving me grappling with the rising tide of my emotions.
 
“Shut the fuck up,” he says. Luca moves up the bed. "Put your wrists together," he instructs, his voice firm yet strangely distant.
 
Complying feels instinctual, even if unease gnaws at my insides. My wrists meet above my head, a vulnerability heightened by the realization of what's about to happen. He loops the rope around them, the rough fibers contrasting with the softness of my skin. The sensation is foreign and unsettling. With my wrists secured, he takes the end of the rope and throws it over the bed's headboard, ensuring that it doesn't twist or turn. Pulling it taut, he ties it to the bed's frame. My arms stretch above my head, my body rendered even more immobile.
 
The sensation of being spread out, vulnerable, and wholly at his mercy stirs a whirlwind of emotions inside of me: fear, anticipation, confusion, and a trace of excitement. With a stab of embarrassment, I realize I am wet. I wonder if Luca can see the growing wetness on my exposed pussy. My heartbeat reverberates in my ears, deafening amidst the thick silence that engulfs the room. I try to shift, but the ropes are unyielding. My field of vision is limited; I can mostly see the ceiling and just the periphery of Luca's form. My breathing grows rapid. This level of restraint is new, even for us. As each moment passes, I find myself craving some form of reassurance from Luca, some indication that he still sees me as Bella and not just an object to be played with.
 
As Luca retreats to the foot of the bed, I can feel the weight of his gaze on me. Every inch of my exposed skin seems to tingle, hyper-aware of his scrutiny. There's no escaping his eyes, which move over me methodically, lingering on the curves and valleys of my body. The intensity of his stare makes me feel like I'm under a spotlight, every detail magnified. I try to read his expression, searching for any hint of the tender Luca I know. But his face remains unreadable, his eyes shadowed with a combination of desire and something more opaque, distant. The heat of his gaze is palpable, but it's devoid of the warmth I usually associate with him. Instead, it feels as though he's seeing me more as a thing, an object for his entertainment, rather than the woman who has shared countless moments of intimacy with him. 

A flush spreads across my body, a mix of embarrassment and trepidation. But beneath that, I can't deny a growing realization. He's undeniably excited by this scene, this version of us. His very posture speaks of it: the set of his shoulders, the slightly parted lips, the way his eyes darken with that particular shade of desire.
 
Yet, as the seconds tick by, the discomfort grows. I yearn for him to say anything to bridge the widening gap between us. The silence in the room becomes deafening, punctuated only by our breaths — his steady, mine increasingly uneven. The balance of power has shifted so drastically, and I'm left grappling with the conflicting emotions churning within me, unsure of how to navigate this new dynamic.
 
Luca climbs onto the bed, the mattress shifting with his weight. Still fully clothed, he positions himself between my legs. His knees are inside my legs, pushing them apart, further exposing my pussy. He looks into my eyes and smiles. I smile back.
 
He bends down and licks the flaps of my pussy. He is soft, his tongue taking its time to navigate; he seems to be taking in my juices, tasting me like an expensive meal. I gasp, pleasure growing from my pelvis and spreading upwards into my stomach. He pulls his head down. I feel his weight shift and his hand move to between my legs. He moves his fingers to either side of my pussy and spreads the skin. With it spread open he bends and licks me. He is rough, more urgent. More primal. His tongue finds my clit and pleasure spikes. I moan. He licks, his tongue steady. He varies the pressure. I want to move my arms and grab his head, but I can’t. He moves his hands and places them on my thighs. He licks harder. The movement is steady and I feel the pressure start to build. He reacts, licking faster, his tongue engulfing my pussy.
 
“Fuck.” It's my voice, but it surprises me; I am only focused on the pleasure.
 
Luca pushes onto my pussy; it feels like he is trying to climb inside me. I tense, my climax close. Luca feels me move and follows the movement with his head.
 
I cum. 

My body tense, the orgasm washing over me. 

Luca keeps licking the pressure the same, the pace quick. The pleasure is intense. I scream. My arms and legs strain against the ropes. I want to grab him, hold him.
 
Luca stops and pulls away. He looks at me and smiles.
 
“That was fucking amazing,” I say. I am still panting.
 
Luca moves from his knees, so is he sitting, still positioned between my legs. He places his hand on my inner thigh. I gasp at the touch, his fingers shooting little sparks of energy down my legs. My skin over sensitive. His fingers trace along my thigh; the touch is soft but electric. His fingers rest at my pussy. He lets the tip of his finger brush my clit. Pleasure ripples through me again. I pull against the bindings but I am unable to move.
 
Without warning, he thrusts his fingers into me. 

“Fuck,” I say. 

For a moment, it feels like his whole hand will be sucked into my pussy. He pulls out and then pushes in again. Faster this time. I close my eyes, the pleasure almost unbearable. I try to pull up my legs, but the rope holds them tight, my legs spread wide. His fingers slip in again. Then out. He builds a rhythm, my wetness allowing him to slide into me without resistance.
 
My climax rises, building in my pelvis and rolling through my body. I tense. He dosen’t stop, his fingers pounding into his pussy. I can hear him breathing hard with the exersion.
 
I cum.
 
My body is tense, pulling at the ropes, but still, he continues.
 
The orgasm subsides. The mixture of pleasure and pain floods my senses. I can’t think straight. All I can focus on is his fingers entering me, brushing my clit, and the flashes pleasure arcing through me.
 
I cum.
 
I try to pull my legs up to protect my pussy, but the rope stops me. I try to pull down my arms to push away his hands, but they are held firm.
 
Still, he continues, his fingers plunging deep over and over again.
 
I cum.
 
“Stop,” I shout. “Please stop.”
 
I am panting, trying to gather my breath. I am trapped, my legs and arms immobile. I want him to stop.
 
“Please.”
 
He stops. His fingers rest inside me but the feeling subsides. I realize I am tense, my body pulling tight on the ropes. I relax and slump into the bed.
 
I feel the weight lift from the bed. I open my eyes. Luca is standing at the end of the bed. He is still dressed but his cock is out. He is hard and holding it.
 
“Watch me,” he says.
 
I watch as he strokes his cock. He is slow at first his hand moving in slow and deliberate movements. I see him close his eyes. His hand moves faster. I see him tense. He holds his breath. There is a low grunt and he sprouts hot, lumpy semen. It splashes onto the bed, a few white lumps landing on my foot. He pushes his cock back into his trousers.
 
The room's emptiness envelops me as Luca slips out of sight. The closing door feels final, echoing my isolation. His absence is almost tangible, leaving me in a state of uncertainty and exposure. The sheets beneath me provide little comfort against the cold touch of doubt and unease that seep into my mind. My limbs feel heavy, weighed down not just by the ropes, but by the onslaught of emotions. The raw vulnerability of my position, the echoing stillness of the room, everything accentuates my sense of helplessness. I can hear the distant sounds of the house, but they only serve to remind me of how isolated I am in this moment. Exhaustion creeps in, every muscle aching, both from our previous encounters and from the tension of my current predicament. My eyes feel heavy, but fear keeps them open, darting around the room as if expecting shadows to come alive. What if he doesn't come back? The thought gnaws at the edges of my consciousness. The vulnerability, fear, and anticipation all make for a potent mix that leaves me restless and anxious.
 
I strain against the ropes, not in any real hope of escaping, but more to feel something other than the mounting dread. They remain steadfast, reminding me of my position and Luca's control.
 
The bedroom door creaks open, Luca's silhouette comes into view, and my heart rate quickens. The glint of a blade sends a fresh wave of panic rushing through me. The cold steel of the knife grazes my skin as he cuts the rope around my ankles. The sudden release sends a rush of sensation back into my feet, a combination of relief and a biting sting as the blood rushes back into the constricted vessels. It feels like pins and needles, tingling and painful all at once. He moves to the rope around my wrists, and with a swift motion, the binding is severed. My hands fall to my sides, heavy and numb from the restraint. I flex my fingers, trying to chase away the uncomfortable sensation, the dull ache giving way to the warm throb of returning circulation.
 
Looking down, angry red marks stand out against the pale backdrop of my skin, a testament to the tightness of the ropes and the time I spent bound. They look painful, and while they smart, it's more the emotional toll that stings—the realization of how vulnerable I'd been and how much trust I'd placed in Luca. I rub my wrists, trying to soothe the irritated skin, while also grounding myself in the reality of the moment. The weight of the ropes, both physical and emotional, is gone, but the aftermath of the experience lingers a complex mixture of relief, fear, and a touch of exhilaration.
 
Luca turns and heads out of the bedroom, leaving me alone and undressed in the cool sheets. There’s no aftercare, no soft words or gentle kisses. A stark departure from the tenderness we usually share. Even after the roughest sex, he would take time to care for me, bringing me back into the moment and helping me from my submissive state to reality. Not this time.
 
As I watch him walk out of the room, an unfamiliar sensation of emptiness washes over me. His touch still lingers on my skin, but it feels like a ghostly echo, a stark reminder of the sudden change in our dynamics. His absence leaves a void in the room, an invisible chasm that swallows up the remnants of our shared intimacy. The warmth of his body is replaced by a creeping cold, a poignant testament to his withdrawal.
 
As my situation settles in, my mind starts racing with thoughts I've been desperately trying to suppress. We are exposed out here in this small village where we're strangers and everyone knows it. How precarious our life has become, a fine balancing act that could tip at any moment, hurtling us into an abyss of danger.
 
The reality is dark, darker than I want to admit. Bianca is dead. I was involved.
 
A thought flashes through my mind, something someone had once said, ‘It's better to control the narrative.’ I can't remember who said it. Is that the answer? I am better getting a hold of the narrative. At least I’d be in control. I could tell my side of the story.
 
The thought of Harrison surfaces in my mind. I've always been aware of him as a potential lifeline, an option to consider if things went sideways. But now, he feels like my only safety net in this precarious dance with danger.

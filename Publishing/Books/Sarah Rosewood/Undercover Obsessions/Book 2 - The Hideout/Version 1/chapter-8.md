## Luca
 
The farmhouse reverberates with an eerie silence. Bella’s absence renders the rooms devoid of the warmth she radiates. Stepping outside, the chill morning air hits my face, a sobering contrast to the cozy warmth of the farmhouse. I look about. There’s no sign of Bella; she should be in the village by now. I walk to the gate, open it and then turn to where my car is parked. I walk carefully over the wet grass, unlocking the car with a soft beep. 
 
Opening the passenger’s door, I reach beneath the dashboard. The package is well concealed, invisible unless you know it's there. It takes me some minutes to pull the tape away. From within the shadows, I withdraw a simple burner phone and a black notebook, its edges worn from use and its pages filled with invaluable information. The notebook is unassuming in appearance but invaluable in content. Inside, the pages are filled with rows of numbers and names, all meticulously recorded. Every single one of them is a doorway into the world I'm trying to shield Bella from, a connection to the underbelly of society I've navigated for years. My eyes scan the listings, my mind working through the options until it settles on one name - Charlie Foster.
 
Sitting in the driver's seat, the worn leather cool beneath me, I press the power button on the phone. For a moment, I panic, thinking the charge may have drained, but I checked it before it was hidden. The screen flashes, and the phone comes on. I let out a breath. I get out of the car and look down the lane. There’s no sign of Bella. I sit back down and key in Charlie's number. The phone rings in my ear, a monotonous tone reverberating with our situation's gravity.
 
“Hello?” The voice is deep, years of whiskey and cigarettes adding a gravely sound to the deep cockney accent.
 
"Charlie?" I greet, attempting to keep the desperation out of my voice.
 
There’s silence on the line for a moment. "Fuck, Luca?" The surprise in his voice is palpable. "Is that you? You have to be shitting me. For fuck’s sake, Luca. I can’t be talking to you."
 
"Yeah, it's me. Listen, Charlie, I need your help. I have a painting-"
 
"No, Luca. You aren't hearing me. I can't talk to you.”
 
"What?" A knot of fear forming in my gut.
 
"You're toxic, Luca. Vittorio has put the word out for you." The line goes silent for a moment, the hum of the connection the only sound in the silence. "Your dad’s not fucking about. He’s spread the word that anyone helping you will be going against him. I am not sure what you’ve done to your old man but he’s got it in for you. I can't risk it. I always liked you Luca, but this is too much. I'm sorry."
 
"Charlie, wait-" 

The line goes dead.
 
"No, no, no," I mumble, redialing the number. I need Charlie. I need his connections and his resources. I ring again, but all I get is the impersonal drone of his answering machine, a clear signal that I've been shut out.
 
I hear the flap of some startled birds, probably crows. I stand and glance down the lane. I see the distant silhouette of Bella, making her way back up the hill towards the farmhouse. With a swift, practiced motion, I slip the burner phone back into the plastic bag next to the small, nondescript black book. I crouch under the seat and allow the black tape to reattach. I push out of the car, shutting the door behind me, the thud echoing in the rural silence.
 
My heart hammers in my chest, its frenzied rhythm in sharp contrast to the serene rural scene before me. I try to slow my breathing to regain some semblance of composure.
 
"Bella," I call out, forcing a smile as I wave her over. My voice, however, carries an edge I can't hide.
 
She pauses mid-stride, her head tilting in her characteristic, curious manner. "Everything okay, Luca?" she calls back, her voice laced with a palpable concern that tugs at my heartstrings.
 
“Yeah," I call out, pushing the words past the lump in my throat. "Everything's fine."

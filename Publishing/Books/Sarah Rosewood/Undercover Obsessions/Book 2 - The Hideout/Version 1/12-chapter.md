# Chapter 12
## Luca
 
Rain drums against the car's roof, the rhythm creating a melancholic soundtrack to my somber thoughts. Each droplet splattering against the windscreen seems to echo the mounting tension coiling within me. I grip the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles white against the worn leather. My mind is a whirlwind, a chaotic mix of desperation, fear, and loss. Once comfortably within my grasp, control now feels like a slippery eel wriggling out of my reach.
 
The lights of the village slice through the misty rain, their warm glow doing little to dispel the icy dread knotting my stomach. The road stretches ahead, slick and gleaming under the street lights. I need more wire and more bells. I need to keep Bella safe.
 
The windshield wipers sweep back and forth, each swish echoing the battle within me - the battle between my past and our future, between my desperation and my love for Bella.
 
As I navigate the narrow bends of the country lane, the village unfolds before me. The buildings are huddled close together, like old friends sharing secrets. The rain is heavier; a thick curtain obscuring my view. I round the corner. A sight catches my eye and makes my heart leap in my chest. 

A police car is parked at the side of the road. I slow to a crawl. The blue and white checkered pattern and the reflective insignia on the side stand out like a beacon in this small, rustic village. My grip tightens on the steering wheel as adrenaline rushes through me. Just ahead of the police car, a man is conversing with a uniformed officer. The local, a burly, middle-aged man with a thick, graying beard, wears a worn-out cap and heavy-duty overalls speckled with paint - a familiar face, the village handyman. He did some work on the cottage last summer. He fixed some of the slates on the roof. I can’t remember his name. Dewi? David? The rain has dampened his hair and matted it down around his face. He's gesturing with broad, exaggerated movements, a characteristic of the locals. The officer, on the other hand, is more reserved. His uniform is crisp, contrasting starkly with the casual attire of the local. The rain drips from his hat.
 
I pull the car over, behind a row of hedges lining the road, and observe. Neither of them notice me, the heavy rain concealing my presence. My heart pounds like a drum as I consider my options. The sight of the police car is unsettling, but I can't afford to panic. The patter of rain on the roof is the only sound as I watch the scene play out before me. 

The policeman ceases talking. He gives the local man a firm pat on the shoulder, a sign of mutual respect, and strides back towards his car. My pulse quickens as I watch him slide into the driver's seat. He sits there, still as a statue, a hand pressed against the radio affixed to his breast. I strain my ears, hoping to catch snippets of his conversation; it's silly; there’s no way I could hear.
 
The officer's head turns, scanning the vicinity, and adrenaline rush sweeps through me. Is he looking for me? Does he know I'm here? The questions ricochet inside my head as I sink lower into my seat, barely daring to breathe. After an eternity, the police car's engine roars to life. The red taillights gleam in the grey afternoon as the car pulls away, the tires splashing against the rain-soaked pavement. As the police car disappears, I let out a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding. I can't shake off the chilling suspicion that he was looking for me. With a glance in the rear view mirror, I steer the car back onto the road, my hands slightly trembling against the wheel.
 
I grip the steering wheel tighter, my knuckles turning white from the strain. A cold sweat trickles down my spine as my mind races through worst-case scenarios. What if they've found us? What if Bella's in danger? The paranoia lurking in the back of my mind, usually kept in check, now dances in the spotlight of my fear.

I turn the car into an entrance of a field. I reverse, make a U turn, and head back the way I had come. 
 
The winding road back to the house seems endless, each turn amplifying my anxiety. The soothing pitter-patter of the rain against the car roof now feels like an ominous drumbeat. I can't shake the image of the police car from my mind, the seemingly casual chat with the local... every minute detail is a potential clue that our cover has been blown. 

The familiar sight of our farmhouse comes into view like a beacon in the storm. But even this comfort is tainted by fear. As I pull up, I'm acutely aware of how exposed and vulnerable we are. The isolation that once felt like freedom now feels like a trap.
 
I switch off the car and sit in silence for a moment, collecting my thoughts. Bella doesn't deserve this. I need to keep her safe. I glance at the rearview mirror one last time before opening the car door, the rain immediately drenching me. Rain-soaked and breathless, I burst through the  door. 

"Bella," I call out. There she is, standing in the kitchen, her worry evident on her face.
 
"What happened, Luca?" she asks, rushing over to me. Her hands grasp my soaked shoulders, her eyes searching mine for answers.
 
"The police... I... saw them in the village," I stammer out my words, they are disjointed by the panic racing through my veins. Bella's eyes widen, but she remains calm, her steady gaze anchoring in my turbulent sea of fear.
 
"Luca. Calm. Breathe. Tell me what you saw.”
 
“A copper was talking to one of the locals; he’s a handyman. He’s done some work in the cottage.”
 
“Ok.” Bella takes a breath. “Tell me more. I need details. One police officer? Uniformed? Was there just one marked car?”
 
“Err… yeah.” Bella’s questions catch me off guard.
 
“You sure,” she says. “Think carefully. It’s important. A single uniformed officer, no other cars, just him."

"Yes," Is say.

"Are you sure? Where there any other cars nearby, ones you have not seen before? It would have been in some kind of estate car, probably dark colored, but powerful.”
 
I look at Bella. Her eyes hold mine, a look of calm. A sense of warmth rolls over me. “Yeah, just a single copper. One police car.” I pause and think, replying the memory in my mind. "No other cars, I am certain."
 
Bella’s hand drops from my shoulder. She seems to relax. “That's good. There could be a hundred reasons why there's a local police officer in the village. It doesn't mean they're here for us."
 
"But I...," I try to argue, but Bella cuts me off.
 
"Come on, Luca. Think logically," she insists. "You know this stuff. If they wanted you, wouldn't they come directly here? Wouldn't they have already knocked on our door? And they wouldn’t send a local plod who’s more used to catching lost sheep; they’d come tooled up, the full deal. Remember what happened to Bianca. They wouldn’t be taking risks. For fuck’s sake, Luca, think about it, you know this shit."
 
Her words strike me like a bolt of lightning. Yes, if they wanted me, they wouldn't wait, wouldn't lurk in the village, wouldn't have casual conversations with locals. They would be here. Her logic, her calm amidst my storm, helps to quell my raging fears. I let out a shaky breath, suddenly aware of my heart pounding.
 
"You're right," I admit, the tension seeping from my body. "You're right, Bella."
 
A faint smile appears on Bella's lips as she releases my shoulders, her eyes never leaving mine. "Now, let's get you out of these wet clothes and into a warm shower," she says, her voice filled with comfort and love.
 
Watching Bella turn away, I find my mind clearing. Panic recedes like a tide, replaced by cold, hard logic. A plan begins to form, tentative at first but growing in clarity and certainty.
 
"Bella," I say, my voice steady. "We need to move. Now. Time's up." I pause, letting the words sink in. "The painting... I need to sell it. Get some money and new passports... we need to get ahead of this." I see her stiffen at my words, her back to me. I know she's processing, weighing the gravity of what I'm saying. The reality of our situation is looming larger than ever now, threatening to swallow us whole if we don't act. "We can't just react anymore," I press on, a newfound determination solidifying my voice. "We need to take control."
 
She remains silent, a quiet stillness enveloping the room, her back to me. The rain pounding on the windows fills the silence. She walks out of the room.

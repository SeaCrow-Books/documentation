# Chapter 7
## Bella
 
The cool morning air brushes against my face and fills my lungs with the fresh scent of the rain-soaked earth. The rain from last night has left behind puddles, their still surfaces reflecting the dawning light. The lane is deserted, the quiet broken only by the chirping of birds. It's peaceful, tranquil even. 
 
I follow the worn path through the village. This is the first time I have ventured this far from the cottage. Luca has been gathering supplies, but this morning he suggested it was time for me to explore the village. If I am honest, I think he wanted me to know where to run to if something happened, but he’s never that direct. I walk along the lane and turn left into the village. I amble down the narrow road, and the quaint charm envelops me. The small cottages with slate roofs on either side, their stone facades weathered yet steadfast, seem to whisper tales of yesteryear. 

The village shop, _Siop Pentref_, is a strangely familiar and comforting sight. I gues it was built before the war but it wears the signs of its years with pride, a pragmatic monument to the passage of time. Across from the shop is an old phone box, the bright red object looking alien to the rest of the village. I push open the door to the shop, the cheerful tinkle of a bell announces my arrival. The shop's interior is a maze of life's essentials, with items arranged in a charmingly haphazard manner. Aisles spill over with everything from fresh produce to imported condiments, their arrangement hinting at a practicality born out of years of service. The air smells musty. Over in one corner stands the counter, its worn surface speaking of countless transactions. Next to it, a small designated area for letters and parcels signifies the shop's dual role as the village's Post Office.
 
Behind the counter, a woman of middle years bustles about, her cheeks a lively shade of rose. Her laughter rings out, clear and heartwarming. She carries herself with a sprightliness that belies her age, her movements imbued with a vibrant zeal that enlivens the very air. Her smile, a beacon of welcome, seems to draw people in, inviting conversation and shared smiles.
 
"Helo, _bore da. Rwy'n falch mae'r glaw wedi rhoi'r gorau iddo o'r diwedd_," she says.
 
A flash of panic overwhelms me. I had not considered she might not speak English.
 
"Er… Good morning," I say, flashing a nervous smile. "I'm Bella."
 
Her eyes brighten with interest. "Well, hello there, Bella. I am Gwen.” She looks me up and down. “You don’t look like a hiker; you’ll not get far in them shoes.” She glances at my shoes and smiles. “So, let me guess, new to the village?" She extends her hand across the counter. I shake it, appreciating the firmness of her grip.
 
"Yes, just moved into the old farmhouse up the lane," I confess.
 
Her face lights up with recognition. "Ah, I thought you might be the one. Iwan did mention Luca was here." She chuckles, her eyes twinkling with mischief. "We don't get many visitors around here, you see. News travels fast. I didn’t realize Luca had a girlfriend. I thought he was married to those paints of his."
 
A pang of unease hits me. How much does she know, or think she knows, about Luca and me? But her demeanor remains warm and inviting, making me believe her words carry no hidden undertones.
 
I nod and smile. "It's a peaceful place," I say. "Quite a change of pace for me."
 
She nods, understanding flashing in her eyes. "Yes, it can take some getting used to, especially for a city girl. But you'll find everything you need here. And if not, a bus goes into town once a day. Meant to leave at 11 but its often late. Picks up just outside."
 
A small sense of relief floods over me at her words. A connection to the outside world. "Thank you, Gwen. That's good to know."
 
She waves away my gratitude, her smile never wavering. "No trouble at all, Bella. It's always nice to see a new face around here."
 
I turn away with a smile and browse through the aisles. I pick up a loaf of fresh bread. I also grab a bottle of milk from the refrigerated section. The mundane task of grocery shopping feels comforting, grounding me in the moment's reality. As I approach the counter, Gwen rings up my items with an efficiency born of years of practice. Her fingers dance over the old till and it beeps with each press. The small screen displays the total, and I hand over the cash.
 
"Thank you, dear," Gwen says, handing me a small blue and white striped plastic bag containing the bread and milk. "Do come again."
 
"I will, Gwen. Thank you," I respond, my heart filled with an unexpected fondness for this quaint village shop and its warm-hearted owner.
 
I return to the bright morning sun with a final smile and a wave.

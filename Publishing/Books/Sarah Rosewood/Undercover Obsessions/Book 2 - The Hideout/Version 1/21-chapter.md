# Chapter 21
## Bella
 
I lie in bed, the sheets and duvet warmed by my body. My eyes are heavy, but I cannot drift into the oblivion of sleep, my mind too full of thoughts, fears, and uncertainties. The soft thud of the front door interrupts the rain's rhythm, pulling me back into the moment. It's Luca. I watch the door as he steps into the room, rainwater dripping from his clothes and hair, his figure silhouetted against the dim light from the hallway. He pauses, perhaps catching his breath, before moving to remove his rain-soaked clothes. He discards his shirt, the wet fabric clinging to his muscled torso before it drops to the floor. His trousers follow. In just his boxers he moves to the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight as he climbs beside me. His body is cold from the rain but a welcome chill against my warmth. He wraps his arm around me, pulling me closer, his chest against my back. I lean into his touch, relishing the safety and comfort it brings. His icy skin gradually warms against mine as we lie cocooned in the duvet. As I turn to face him, my eyes are drawn to the curves and angles of his face, the subtle marks of age and experience. The scruff of his stubble, the strong curve of his jaw, the light flecks in his green eyes. I trace my fingers over his chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my fingertips. My gaze travels the length of his torso, marking the path of each muscle and each contour of his body. His arm tightens around me as I move closer, pressing my body against his. The heat between us grows, a warm shield against the chill of the rainy night outside. I rest my head on his chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heart. 

In his arms, I find a strange peace amidst the chaos. There's a sense of home in his embrace, an anchor in the storm that rages outside. As the rain continues to beat against the window, I realize that regardless of what lies ahead, as long as I'm with Luca, I'm safe. A powerful emotion swells within me, a deep-seated adoration that feels both familiar and new, urging me to draw even closer. I press myself further into the crook of his arm, seeking an insatiable closeness. The warmth between us builds, an ember that promises to shield us from the world's chill. Laying my head against his chest, the rhythmic dance of his heart in my ear becomes a lullaby. 

I extract myself from the warm cocoon of Luca's embrace and reposition myself to kneel before him on the bed. I raise my gaze, meeting his, and all unease vanishes. There's a depth in Luca's eyes that I've come to know so intimately. Today, it seems to be a mosaic of emotions. Beneath the ardent shimmer of his pupils, I see layers of love, interwoven with unmistakable desire. It's as if, in that split second, all his defenses crumble, and I'm granted a view into his soul's most profound recesses. His eyes travel my form, not with the ravenous intent of mere lust, but with a passion that's founded in genuine affection. It's a gaze that cherishes, one that sees beyond the physical to the emotional and spiritual bonds we share. And it's this profound connection that makes the intensity of his look feel so empowering.

Sliding my fingers to the hem of the t-shirt, I lift it over my head. The fabric, one of Luca's old shirts, brushes against my skin, carrying with it the familiar scent of him. As it lands in a soft heap beside me, I'm left only in my knickers, the room's cool air causing a gentle shiver to cascade down my spine.

I glance up, finding Luca's gaze already fixed on me. His eyes travel to my breasts, and an appreciative smile graces his lips. It's not just the lecherous admiration of a man; it's a tender acknowledgment, a silent commendation of our deep connection. The warmth in his gaze makes me feel seen, cherished, and desired in the most profound way. The slightest hint of a blush creeps up my cheeks, not from embarrassment but from the depth of emotion this simple exchange evokes. The intensity of the moment is almost palpable, as if the very air around us is charged with our shared passion and understanding. In Luca's smile, I see more than just admiration; I see love, a profound connection, and the promise of many more shared moments to come.

As he begins to shift, closing the distance between us. I raise a hand. "Stay," I whisper, my voice laced with a playfulness and confidence I didn't know I possessed.

Luca's eyes darken a shade, but he complies, reclining against the pillows. His chest rises and falls in quick, shallow breaths, a clear sign of the restraint he's showing. He watches me, waiting for my next move, and in that silence, the tension thickens, making my pulse race.

I tower over him, and my fingers start their journey across my own body. The skin of my chest tingles at the soft touch, each fingertip feeling like a spark against my flesh. Luca's gaze is intense, following the path my fingers take, and I can sense his restraint cracking. Each movement is deliberate, an intimate dance just for him. I draw circles around the sensitive peaks of my breasts, relishing in the gentle caress that makes my skin prickle with goosebumps. A soft sigh escapes my lips, a sound that seems amplified in the quiet room.

My hands continue their descent, skimming over the gentle curve of my waist, a whisper of sensation that leaves a trail of heat in its wake. Luca's eyes are fixed, unwavering as they follow every movement. By the time my fingers hover over the edge of my knickers, the air between us is thick with anticipation. His jaw clenches as he fights the urge to take control. I push my fingers into my knickers, letting them push downwards. I follow Luca’s eyes, this gaze fixed on my fingers behind the thin fabric. I brush over my lips, I am already wet. I let the tip of my finger brush my clit. I gasp and close my eyes with pleasure. Unable to stop I push my fingers inside and allow the wetness to cover them. 

The intimate quiet that surrounds us is broken only by our synchronized breathing. Opening my eyes, I'm met with Luca's intense gaze, full of raw desire. The corners of my lips quirk up in a knowing smile, and I can't help but tease him with what I've discovered. Withdrawing my fingers, the unmistakable evidence of my arousal glistens in the room's soft light. 

"Would you like a taste?" I ask.

“Yes,” his voice is little more than a whisper. 

I stretch out my arm, offering him my wet fingers. Luca's gaze never leaves mine as he leans forward. His movements are gentle and unhurried as he envelops my fingers with the warmth of his mouth. The sensation of his tongue swirling around, tasting and savoring, sends a jolt of pleasure through me. I pull my fingers back and allow my hands to reach to my underwear. Keeping eye contact, I slide my knickers down, I let them fall to the bed, leaving me bared to Luca's gaze. 

I look into Luca's eyes, and the depth of understanding there sends shivers down my spine. 

“Tell me that you want your pussy,” I say. He looks at me and smiles. “I am serious; tell me, Luca.” I need to hear him say it. “Tell me that this pussy is yours. Tell me that I belong to you.”

The evening sky blankets the world outside with inky darkness, only the faintest specks of stars peeping through. I lift the last bag into the car's boot, pushing it in next to the others. I shut the boot and pat it twice, an old habit from days when we used to do road trips. The bags fit just right, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. I walk around to the driver's side and slide into the seat. The familiar scent of the car - a mix of worn leather and the pine air freshener Bella likes - brings a small comfort. I turn the key, the engine humming to life. The fuel gauge shows full, a green light glowing in the dimness of the car. Bella insisted we fill up the tank earlier in the day; she's always been the more practical one.

A cool breeze blows as we exit the car, carrying with it the sweet scent of the surrounding countryside. We'd fallen in love with this little cottage, and despite everything, leaving it behind stings. With a deep breath, I head back into the cottage to find Bella in the kitchen; she's cleaning. The room is stark and empty, devoid of the homely warmth it usually has.

"This is it," I say, more to myself than Bella.

She looks up at me, her eyes glistening in the soft light. I can see our fear reflected in her gaze, but also a flicker of hope. We've come so far, and taken so many risks. And now, we're on the precipice of a new beginning, a new life. We've still got a long way to go, but in this moment, I feel ready. As long as we have each other, we can face anything that comes our way. We can do this. We must.

"Everything packed?" I ask, looking at her. 

She nods, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel. She has that determined look in her eyes. We move towards each other as if pulled by a magnetic force. Wrapping my arms around her, I pull her close, feeling her body mold against mine. I lean down to capture her lips with mine, a silent promise passing between us.

Pulling away, I move over to the kitchen drawer. My hand hovers over the handle for a moment before pulling it open. There, nestled among the everyday items, is the gun. I take it to the table and sit down, spreading a clean cloth beneath it. Bella's eyes follow the weapon, a flicker of fear in their depths. She's seen me clean it before, but the significance is not lost on either of us. I start to disassemble the gun, laying out the pieces. The routine is familiar and comforting in its simplicity. The slide comes off first, then the barrel and recoil spring. I clean each part meticulously, my movements practiced and precise. Bella watches from her place by the counter, her eyes following my every move. Once cleaned, I start to reassemble it, each piece sliding back into its rightful place with practiced ease. 

Carrying the gun, we head into the bedroom. I place the gun in its hiding place under the bed.

Bella turns off the light, casting the room into darkness, save for the sliver of moonlight filtering through the window. The shadows play across her face, emphasizing the curve of her cheek and the sparkle in her eyes. I climb into bed and she follows. I pull her into my arms, feeling her body press against mine. Her head fits perfectly in the crook of my neck, her breath warm against my skin. Her arms tighten around my waist. I capture her lips with mine, a silent vow passed between us in the darkness. Her lips are warm and inviting.

I watch, her eyes full of intent, as her fingers begin to wander, tracing the contours of my chest and abdomen. There's an unspoken intimacy in her touch, one that makes my heart race even after all we've shared. She sits up, her fingers catching the hem of my t-shirt. I lift my arms, allowing her to pull it off, the fabric slipping away to reveal my bare torso. The cool air hits my heated skin, but that coolness is short-lived as Bella's fingers, warm and exploratory, continue their dance.

She moves her hands down my body. She unbuckles the belt of my jeans, opens the button and unzips them. I shift my weight as she pulls them off me. She loops her fingers around the hem of my boxer shorts and pulls. I allow them to be removed. 

The sensation of being completely exposed to Bella is a strange mix of vulnerability and empowerment. It's an unfamiliar feeling, like I've laid my soul bare before her. There's no hiding now, no mask to wear, just the raw essence of who I am, framed by the dim light filtering through the curtains. But amidst the vulnerability, there's a driving force, a deep-rooted need to give Bella the same pleasure she's given me countless times. I want her to feel cherished, desired, and adored. I want her to lose herself in the moment, to forget everything but the two of us and the intoxicating dance of intimacy we're sharing.

She takes my hand and guides my fingers to my cock. I am solid, the pre-cum glistening. She wraps my fingers around the shaft, her hand also on mine. She starts to move her hand, guiding me to wank myself. 

“On your back,” she says. 

I roll onto my back. I can see her looking at my body, her eyes falling to my cock. 

Lying here, exposed and at Bella's mercy, a weight of vulnerability presses down on me. There's a difference between being desired and feeling like an object, and in this moment, I feel trapped between the two. The lingering glances, the way her eyes dissect every part of me, it's almost as if I've been transformed into a piece of art she's appraising, rather than the partner she loves.

A wave of insecurity crashes over me. I've always prided myself on being strong and in control, but this sensation... Rather than comforting, every caress, every touch from Bella, now feels like a claim.

“Wank for me.” Her voice is firm. 

I shift the grip on my cock and close my eye. I allow my hand to move in a slow and deliberate motion. I let my fingers squeeze the bulge of the head, causing pleasure to throb through my cock. 

“That’s it,” she says.

I move my hand faster, the motion sends spikes of pleasure through my body. I open my eyes to see here looking. Her eyes are locked on my cock. 

“That’s it, cum for me.”

I move my hand faster, in quick smooth jerks. The tension builds. I can feel my orgasm raising through my body. 

“Yes.” The word slips out. 

“Cum.” It is a command. She is demanding it.

The tension becomes too much and I cum. My sperm shoots into the air, coming to land on my cock, my pubic hair, and my stomach. I keep moving my hand, pumping each last drop of sperm from my cock. 

“Fuck,” she says. “That’s a lot of cum.”

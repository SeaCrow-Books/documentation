# Chapter 20
## Luca
 
Standing in the dim light of the kitchen, I find myself rooted to the spot, my gaze drawn to the window. Outside, the world is being scrubbed clean by the pouring rain, each droplet hammering down with a determined ferocity that is as mesmerizing as it is daunting. The wind howls, bending the trees in a terrible ballet of nature's power. The landscape, usually so inviting, is an intimidating spectacle of elemental fury. The window pane is slick with rain, rivulets coursing down the glass in haphazard patterns, like little races being run, their paths converging and diverging in an unpredictable dance. I step out into the torrent, letting the rain wash over me, feeling the cold seep into my skin, and steeling myself for what lies ahead. The storm shows no mercy as I dart across the path, leaving the safety of the cottage behind. The rain pelts against my skin, quickly soaking through my clothes. It's a harsh, cold downpour that takes my breath away. The rain slicks my hair back, droplets trickling down my face, blurring my vision. I reach the car, my heart hammering in my chest more from the situation than the sprint. Fumbling with the keys, I unlock the door and practically throw myself inside, pulling the door shut behind me with a force that sends a shudder through the vehicle.
 
The thrumming of the rain on the metal roof fills the car. I reach under the dashboard. My fingers brush against the cool, smooth surface of the burner phone. Retrieving it, I remove it from the clear plastic bag. I turn it on and watch as it blinks to life, the glowing screen a small beacon in the otherwise dim interior of the car. The phone takes its time searching for a signal, the little icon on the top corner of the screen flickering. I can't help but hold my breath, praying to whatever gods may be listening that it connects. Every second feels like an hour, the tension building up in my chest with each passing moment. After what feels like a small eternity, the signal icon stabilizes. Two bars. Not great, but it'll do. I let out a breath I didn't realize I was holding, a small wave of relief washing over me.
 
My fingers fly over the tiny, stiff buttons, punching in the number. The dial tone buzzes in my ear, a static-filled symphony heightening my anxiety. A heartbeat. Two. Three. Each one ticks by with agonizing slowness. The ringing stops.
 
"Hello, Rico?" I say, my voice barely above a whisper.
 
A gruff voice comes through the phone. "Luca. This needs to be quick."
 
"Rico, do we have the passports?" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady despite my heart racing.
 
There's a pause, and for a moment, I can only hear the pounding rain on the car roof and the static crackle on the line. "Luca, you understand the risk here, right?" he says. "You understand what you're putting me through?"
 
"I understand, Rico," I reply. "I know it's hard, but it's our only way out."
 
Another pause. My fingers tighten around the phone.
 
"I've got them. Two passports. One for you, one for Bella." 

"Thank you, Rico," I breathe out a heavy sigh. "Rico, I need one more favor."
 
Rico's voice hardens. "For fuck's sake, don't you think you have asked for enough? What is it, Luca?"
 
"Someone's been in the cottage," I say, feeling my stomach tighten. "Someone knows where we are. We need to leave now. I need you to bring the passports to us."
 
"Luca, are you mad?" Rico snaps. "I can't risk it. I'm already balls-deep in your shit."
 
"I know," I plead, desperation creeping into my voice. "But it's life or death now. We have to move, and we have no time. Please."
 
The line is silent for a moment. I wait, heart pounding, for Rico's response.
 
"Fine... But where are you, Luca?"
 
I pause. I know I need to tell him but a little voice at the back of my mind is screaming for me just to hang up the phone and find another way. I take a breath. "Do you remember that old cottage I bought in Wales years ago?"
 
"Wales? You're joking, right? Fuck, that old place; I thought you sold that. Yeah, you defiantly told me you sold it.”
 
“I lied.”
 
“I thought that place would've crumbled down by now," Rico says, surprise unmistakable in his voice. “Why did you keep it and why did you lie to me?”
 
"Remember when we came here that time?" I ask. "We went hiking?"
 
Silence lingers on the other end of the line for a moment before Rico responds, his tone much softer, "Yeah, Luca... I remember. So you're asking me to come there?" Rico's voice is laced with disbelief and uncertainty. I can tell he's weighing up the danger against his loyalty to me.
 
"Yeah," I say, holding my breath, "I need you here tomorrow."
 
There's a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, followed by a long string of curses. When he's done venting, Rico lapses into silence, and I can almost hear the gears turning in his head. "Luca..." he begins, but his voice trails off.
 
"Rico, I need you to do this. Please," I beg. I hate how desperate I sound.
 
Rico exhales on the other end. "I remember where it is. I'll leave in the morning. But Luca," his voice turns serious, "this better be worth it."
 
He hangs up.

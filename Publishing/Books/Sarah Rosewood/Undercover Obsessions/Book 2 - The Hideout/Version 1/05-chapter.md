# Chapter 5
## Bella
 
I'm nestled in the crook of our couch, a steaming mug of tea cradled in my hands, its warmth seeping into my skin and providing a small comfort against the relentless rain battering the windows. Luca left shortly after the unexpected visitor. He's been gone an hour.
 
I stare at the window above the sink, my eyes tracing the rivulets of rain as they race down the glass. It's not just any rain - it's the kind of downpour that seems to penetrate every corner, seeping into the very marrow of the land and making everything wet and cold. 
 
It all seemed so simple, so blissfully perfect - the rugged artist and the renegade police officer finding love in the most unlikely circumstances. But as I stare into the depths of my cup, I am jolted by the harsh sting of reality. I am a police officer. And yet here I am, on the run with a man who has done things I can’t think about. 

And now… our lives are hanging by the thread of a fake painting.
 
I rub my temples, the irony of it all threatening to engulf me.
 
And then there’s the Vella Gang. Rico's menacing face haunts my nightmares, a stark reminder of the danger that is never too far away. A shudder courses through me, the thought of them finding us filling me with an icy dread. And Vittorio. He will be hell-bent on revenge after Bianca’s death; there’s no knowing what he will do or what he is even capable of doing. I am sure he will blame me for what has happened.
 
As I mull over my tea, my turn towards the painting. It's so lifelike, so authentic in its detail, that it may pass for the real thing to the untrained eye. But the truth is, it's a counterfeit. Perhaps, just perhaps, Luca could sell it. If he was successful, it could provide us with the means to start over, vanish into obscurity and live out our days in peace. But the thought of what could happen if things go wrong sends a chill down my spine. It's a game of Russian roulette.
 
Suddenly, he's there, materializing at the doorway with an abruptness that startles me.
 
I hadn't heard the car over the drumming rain. He's soaked to the skin, his clothes clinging to him, water dripping from his hair. He's carrying a bundle of firewood in his arms, which he unceremoniously dumps into a corner. The wood lands with a thud, scattering bits of bark. He seems lost in thought, his mind miles away, his usually lively eyes clouded with a distracted, far-off look. 

Swallowing the lump in my throat, my fingers playing with the hem of my shirt. "Luca," I begin, my voice softer than I intended. He glances back at me, his eyebrows raising in silent question. I can see the distracted gleam in his eyes, the way his mind seems to be elsewhere. "About Iwan's visit," I venture, watching his expression shift. I can almost see the wall coming up, the way he mentally steels himself for the conversation. "I... I just can't stop thinking about it. About the car. What if it had been someone else? What if..."
 
Luca look at me. "Bella, it'll be okay," he says, a hint of impatience creeping into his tone. His hand comes up in a brushing-off gesture, as if he could physically sweep away my worries.
 
I watch as he shrugs off his wet jacket. Luca moves across the room, his footsteps heavier than usual, echoing my own sense of foreboding. He reaches the sink, pausing for a split second as his fingers wrap around the tap, but instead of turning it, he remains still. He turns to face me, and our eyes lock. There's a depth in his gaze, a storm of emotions I can't quite decipher. 
 
The room suddenly feels smaller, the walls closing in. I shift in my spot, suddenly all too aware of every little sound - the soft hum of the generator and the drum of the rain. 
 
"Stand," he says. 

I stare at him. There's a tone in his voice that I've heard before. My heart skips a beat, a subtle mix of anticipation and unease swirling within. Perhaps even fear.
 
"Stand up, Bella." 

My body responds before my mind fully processes the command, and I find myself rising to my feet. 
 
“Undress,” he says.
 
I feel a cold knot forming in the pit of my stomach. 

"Undress," he repeats.

"Luca," I begin, my voice trembling.
 
A part of me wants to defy him. I'm torn between self-preservation and the fear of further escalating the situation. All the while, his eyes remain on me, unwavering. The room seems to shrink, the walls closing in, and I'm acutely aware of every heartbeat, every breath.
 
“Fucking undress.”
 
I can feel the weight of his stare, an almost tangible pressure, as I begin to undress. Each movement feels deliberate and mechanical. The air grows cooler with every layer I shed until the room's chill wraps itself around me, making my skin prickle. The fabrics slide off, pooling around my feet, and with each piece of clothing I remove, I feel more and more exposed, more vulnerable.
 
I'm standing, completely naked. I can't help but cross my arms over my chest. Tears threaten to form, but I blink them away, refusing to let them spill. I won't give him the satisfaction of seeing me break. 
 
Luca's eyes have always been windows to his emotions, but now, as they travel over me, they're clouded and distant. The warmth and love I was so used to seeing in them are conspicuously absent. Instead, there's a predatory glint that makes my skin crawl. As he leers, not a single part of me feels untouched by his gaze. It's invasive, unsettling. It's as if he's looking through me, not at me, seeing me not as the Bella he knows but as a mere object for his appraisal.
 
“Sit,” he says, nodding to the couch.
 
I sit, crossing my legs, my arms still shielding my breasts from his view.
 
“Move forward, on the edge.”
 
I do as he says, dropping my arms to hold my weight, my hard nipples suddenly exposed. I shuffle forward moving my bare buttocks in the edge of the worn cushion, the threadbare material rough against my skin.
 
“Good girl,” he says. “Now.” He smiles. “Open your legs.”
 
I look into his eyes, wanting to hesitate but I feel I need to submit. “Yes sir.” I open my legs, exposing my pussy to him.
 
“Wider.”
 
I open them wider. I feel the cold air touch me.
 
“Good.” I glance away and glance back; I am sure he has just licked his lips. “Now, use your fingers to spread your pussy for me. Show me what is mine.”
 
For a moment, I am not sure what to do. This is new and he’s never asked for this before. He meets my eyes. I feel the urge to comply. I sit back a little and move my hands down to rest either side of my pussy. I allow my fingers to touch the flaps. I pull them apart, just a little.
 
“More.” His voice is firm.
 
I pull the lips apart as far as I dare, exposing my pussy to Luca. He smiles. His eyes locked between my legs. A moment passes and we don’t move.
 
“Can I stop now?” I ask. I feel vulnerable under his gaze.
 
“Yes Baboon.”
 
I remove my hands, close my legs and cross my arms.
 
“Now crawl to me.”
 
“What?”
 
“You fucking heard. Get on your hands and knees and crawl to me.”
 
I lift myself from the couch and position my body on the floor. I am on my hands and knees, my naked skin suddenly cold. The chill of the tiles bites into my knees. I find myself lowering my head, trying to shield my face from Luca's unsettling gaze. Crawling across the expanse of the kitchen floor, the rough texture of the tiles grating against my palms, I'm painfully aware of how exposed I am, of the weight of his gaze upon me. The vulnerability is palpable, choking. It's an unfamiliar feeling, this sense of being so utterly powerless in his presence. Each movement is deliberate and calculated. I can't shake the image of myself as a scalded dog, beaten down and submissive. The degrading nature of the act makes me want to recoil, to stand and face him as an equal, but I am not his equal; he is my ‘sir,’ and he knows what is best for me and us.
 
I stop at Luca’s feet. I tuck my feet under my buttocks and sit before him. The floor is cold and the tiles hurt my shins and knees. Luca looks down at me. I see his hands move to his trousers. He unbuckles his belt. I fear he will beat me, but he lets the buckle and end hang down as he unbuttons his trousers and unzips his fly. His hands push into his boxers, and he produces his cock. He is hard. 

Despite everything, I want him.
 
“I bet you can’t wait to feel this,” he says, his hard cock in his hand.
 
“Yes,” I say. I hate that I am not lying. I do want to feel him.
 
“Beg.”
 
I look into his eyes. “Please sir, fuck me with you magnificent cock.”
 
“Good girl. Stand up, hands on the sink, arse in the air.”
 
Luca steps to the side as I stand. I brush past him and position myself as he has requested. For a moment, I am aware that he is clothed and I am naked. The cool metal of the sink presses against my palms as I lean forward, positioning myself as Luca desires. My mind drifts to the mark on my neck, a bruise that serves as a dark reminder of our last time at the sink. The sensation of him marking me, claiming me, had been a heady mix of pain and pleasure. 
 
I hear the slap of skin on skin and a flash of pain sparks through my body. I let out a small scream. My buttock is alive with pain. I take a breath and Luca slaps me again. It is hard. I feel tears prickle into my eyes. 

For a split second, the safeword flashes into my mind – 'baboon'. We had put it in place the first night at this cottage. Laying naked in bed, Luca had explained that just saying the word would stop everything. When he told me, I vowed never to say it. But, this is different, darker. I want to say it, to stop him and regain control. I feel him step toward me. Fuck him. He will not have the pleasure of hearing me say that word. I can take his little games. He will not…
 
He is in me.
 
His cock slides into my wet pussy with no resistance. He hammers into me, hard and unrelenting. A gasp of air escapes each time he thrusts and my body is trapped between him and the sink. I hear the clatter and smash of what sounds like a cup or dish. He keeps thrusting. His hard cock drilling into me. He slows a little, and I take a breath, composing myself. I feel him shift his weight. 

Pain shoots from my scalp. I realize he has grabbed my hair from behind. I worry he’s going to rip it from the roots. My head is pulled back, and I look up at the ceiling. I see a small spider’s web tucked away in the corner of the room. I focus on the web, trying to ignore the pain. 
 
He drives into me again. This time it is harder, more brutal. He is pounding at me. I try to focus but I can’t think.
 
The pain from him holding my hair.
 
The pleasure of his hard cock.
 
Fighting for breath as the air is squeezed out of me with each push, making me pant like a dog.
 
The pain of the sink’s edge, hard on my stomach.
 
The flashes of ecstasy as this man I love uses me.
 
He cums with a loud grunt. I feel his hot sperm fill me. He slows and stops, squirting twice more. He pulls out. I feel the liquid drip from my pussy and down the inside of my leg.
 
“Put your clothes on.” His voice is broken as he tries to catch his breath.
 
I relax and turn. I expect Luca to be there ready to comfort me but all I see is his back as he heads to the bedroom.

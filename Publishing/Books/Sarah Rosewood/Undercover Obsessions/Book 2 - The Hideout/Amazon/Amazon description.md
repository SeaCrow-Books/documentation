**I have risked everything for love.**

I am a police officer in love with a dangerous criminal. 

I have risked everything for this man but the stakes could not be higher. 

We are running from the police, running from a lethal gang, running from ourselves. 

One false step could be lethal.

But it's all a lie. 

Our one chance to escape is a stolen painting that can never be sold. 

I never thought I would be in this situation, risking my life for this man but...

The way he looks at me, the way he makes me feel when he touches me, I am his, completely. He owns me. 

I am alive with him. My true self. 

If only we can keep running and find a way to escape, a way we can love each other completely. 

I risk everything for this man.

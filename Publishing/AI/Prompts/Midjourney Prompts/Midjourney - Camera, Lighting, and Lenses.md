Cameras and lenses üé•- Midjourney

  

I've compiled a list of some of the best professional cameras and lenses for various scenarios such as camera angle, lighting, ambiance, styling, and genre. Of course, there may be other similar lists out there, but in case you didn‚Äôt come across one, maybe it can be a bit useful for those looking to experiment with different camera settings for your scenes. Although some of these selections may not make a substantial impact, they can bring an extra level of refinement to your project. Please share your feedback and favorite combinations so we can make the list even better!

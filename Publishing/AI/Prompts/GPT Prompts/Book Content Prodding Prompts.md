Prompts we used successfully when rewriting the book.

1. I don't like you starting with adverbial starting phrases like "Finally," so please avoid that. I like everything you did, but I would like some more location description here since it's the opening scene
2. When going scene for scene Chat won't know what the next piece of text is, so include this clause at the beginning of each prompt: *Please be mindful of connecting the previous generated text to the next section that I will paste below. Prioritize a natural flow. However, do not cut out any plot information in favor of the flow, instead, rather expand on the text to account for all the plot information when prioritizing the flow.*
3. You need to prioritize that plot details should not be altered, otherwise it will cut important information.

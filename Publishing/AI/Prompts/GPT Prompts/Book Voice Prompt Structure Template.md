This was a thought experiment. We ended up using a different approach of Custom instruction for author and then Character Context sheet.
But this was my initial approach:

>[!note] Concept Ideas - Author Voice Toning
>Thought to use this template and ask Chat to analyze an author's writing and fill in the template. That way we have an Author Style Clone #experimental

## Custom Instructions
#### Overview of main instructions: 
(show, don’t tell, balance grammatical structures, POV, main tense, etc.)

#### Clause based on these instructions: 
(prioritize flow and natural reading)


#### Author Voice Sheet: 
(laid out in the form of a fill-in checklist so that multiple author voices can be created) 
Only add elements relevant to the author’s voice here so nothing overlaps/contradicts with the character voices. This will primarily be literary techniques and devices, reading level (conversational, informative, etc.), overall thematic element choices, word choice that dictates tone (dark, light-hearted, etc) with a priority clause

#### Author voice Clause: 
(tell it to prioritize blending and not clashing with the character voices whenever relevant to the character voice per scene. Add a sub-clause that doesn’t push it into a corner)

#### Character 1 Voice Sheet:
Only add elements relevant to the character’s voice here so nothing overlaps/contradicts with the author’s voice. This will primarily be: diction-level relevant to the character (as well as any regional accents or idiosyncrasies),  

#### Character 1 Voice Clause:
>[!note] Concept Ideas - Voice Clause
> For these clauses it might be a good idea to build in a "priority scale" where we tell Chat where the highest priorities lie so that if it runs into a contradiction/problem, it has an escape route.

A blog persona can be crafted through a combination of Prose, Voice, and Tone Elements.
However, AI in general can respond differently from one element to another depending on how vague or descriptive the term is. Additionally, [[Weighted Terms]] can have a wildcard affect on your prompting.

To gain some control over how AI, specifically Chat GPT, responds to this, we use a Green, Blue, Red key to show what you can include in a custom instruction, what you should be wary of, and what would definitely skew GPT's performance.

Rico is maimed and disfigured; he folds into himself and is filled with darkness. He meets a woman (man?), who, at first, he rejects, but over time he comes to understand the person can see past his disfigurement and into a better version of himself. He teaches Rico to love himself and turn his back on a life of crime. 

This could be the person who is rehabilitating after the books. The problem is that he would be in prison.  

Rico has to make some kind of choice, but he picks the person. 

Perhaps the person helps Rico to escape.

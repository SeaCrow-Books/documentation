In the modern landscape of book production, it's crucial to differentiate between the text, styling, book format, and delivery system. Treating these components separately facilitates a flexible and adaptive publishing process. 

1. Text Creation The core of a romance book resides in its text. Maintaining a format-agnostic text is advisable to ensure versatility across different publishing platforms. Using simplistic text formats like Markdown is ideal. Markdown’s plain text formatting syntax is user-friendly and easily convertible to other formats. Moreover, adhering to a text-based language like Markdown enhances software flexibility. It facilitates the use of a variety of editing tools, be it a simple text editor, Microsoft Word, or more sophisticated environments like Visual Studio Code, without being restrained by proprietary software constraints. 
2. Styling Styling enriches the aesthetic appeal of a book while being distinct from the text. This separation fosters a cleaner, more structured approach to book design. Styling can be tailored to meet the demands of different formats and platforms, often utilizing formats like CSS to create consistent styling templates which maintain a coherent visual identity across various renditions of the book. 
3. Book Format The book format encompasses the technical structure that houses the text and styling. Common formats include EPUB, MOBI, HTML, and PDF. The choice of format can have a significant impact on the book’s appearance and accessibility. It’s wise to choose a format that aligns well with the targeted delivery platforms, ensuring a smooth reading experience. Moreover, most software tools can easily convert text in Markdown to the required book format. This ease of conversion is attributed to the absence of proprietary styling elements unique to the software used during text creation, making the transition between text and format straightforward. 
4. Delivery System The delivery system represents the final step in the book production process, distributing the formatted book to readers through various platforms. For instance, MOBI is favored for Amazon, while EPUB is suitable for Apple's ecosystem. A robust delivery system ensures readers have access to the book in a convenient format. Providing links to different format options on a webpage further extends the book’s accessibility, catering to a broader audience with varied reading preferences. 

This modular approach to book production not only streamlines the process but also ensures a level of adaptability and efficiency, allowing publishers to navigate the diverse requirements of modern publishing with ease.

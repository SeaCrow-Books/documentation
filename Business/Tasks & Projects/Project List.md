>### Tasks
>
>A **task** is an objective or problem that can be resolved with a single action.  
>
>So, for example, If you needed to update the title on a blog post, this would be a **task** since it can be completed in a single action.
>
>A task should be clearly defined in a way that the action and outcome is clear. For example, 'Fix post title' is a poorly defined task since it is an unclear action with no defined outcome. A better task would be 'Update the title of the The Ultimate Guide pillar post so that is it optimized for the seo term *romance fiction*.'
>
> Tasks should be assigned to the [[Task List]], whilst project should be given there own file and added to the list at the top of this page.
>
>#### Assigning tasks
>When it is clear who is responsible for the **task** to be completed it should be assigned a todo tag, for example: #todo/ben or #todo/gary 
>
>### Projects
>A **project** is a list of tasks with a clearly defined goal. A project can't be completed by a single task. 
>
>1. **Clarity**: The project name should clearly reflect the desired outcome. This helps to keep the focus on what you aim to achieve.
>2. **Specificity**: A good project name should be specific enough that you know exactly what it entails without being so detailed that it becomes unwieldy.
> 3. **Motivation**: Use names that motivate and give you energy when you think about them. This can help you to maintain momentum.
> 4. **Action-Oriented**: While GTD focuses more on the action steps (the "next actions" in GTD lingo) to move projects forward, naming your project in an action-oriented way can remind you of the motion and progress you want to maintain.
> 5. **Reviewability**: Projects in GTD should be reviewed regularly. A well-named project will make it easier to quickly remember the purpose of the project during these reviews.
>
> When naming projects in GTD, consider the following tips:
>
> - **Use nouns and verbs**: For example, instead of "Website," you might name a project "Launch New Product Website." 
> - **Keep it simple**: Don't get too complex with names; keep them easy to understand and recall. 
> - **Consider context**: Sometimes including context in the project name can be helpful, such as "Q1 Marketing Campaign." 
> - **Prioritize**: If you have multiple projects, you might include a prioritization or sequencing system in your naming convention (e.g., "P1 - Office Relocation"). 
>
>### Assigning a priority
>The day to day workflow will set the priority for for tasks and these should be reviewed on a regular basis. 
>
>A project should be given on of three statuses:
>
> #status/active - This is live and actionable.
> #status/waiting - This is waiting for the situation to change so it becomes actionable. 
> #status/someday-maybe  - This is a future project
>
> The status of all projects should be assessed on a regular basis, at least once a week. 
>

>However, if you needed to build a system to optimize a blog post this would be a **project** since it requires multiple tasks to reach the goal.

Idea for GPTS

- Book proposal
- Synopsis
- Blog post formatting
- Tone picker that's great at isolating tone and writing style of other authors according to our own prerequisites. So we can include similar concepts in our own books.
- Structure and plot formatting
- This is a very niche idea, but I think it might be a good idea to use Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) to enrich descriptions. For example, if you have a character who is an experienced woodsman, readers will expect to read very detailed and accurate descriptions of fauna and flora as well as use-cases, seasonal availability, etc. Another example is a weapons master or a horse handler that gives accurate descriptions and advice, thus immersing the characters deeper and keeping them interested. The same is true if you do a detective or forensic specialist. We are able to give descriptions and use story elements that are actually relevant to specific professions without having to do months of research. --- So I'm playing with the idea of having base "preset" instructions and configurations for GPTs when writing, and then including subject-specific SPRs tuned to a character's profession/expertise/interest per story just to make everything more interesting and engaging.

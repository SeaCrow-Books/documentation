Consider the idea of fine tuning using all of SeaCrow's blog posts.  If we create this blog it can be the foundation of the blog fine tune.

So my current understanding is that though fine tuning will be useful it is best seen as advanced custom instructions. It is unclear how useful it would be at loading dataset. I think this might be more the idea of embedding. 

I feel that I need to experiment more. 

I could see a situation where we created a fine tuned engine to match work flow, so we would have an author 1 engine or a blog engine, which have been toned to match what we need.

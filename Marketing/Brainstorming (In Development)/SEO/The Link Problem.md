## Problem 
We need to add links to blog posts for SEO but Chat is being a bitch about it. 
## Solution 1
We create a file of whitelisted websites, this would contain the link, some information, perhaps some 'tags'.

The list would be updated in the 'outlining' phase and then used to write the post. 

Using Chat is 'Advanced Data Analysis' mode would allow it to be uploaded. 
## Solution 2
We finetune chat to create 'outline' and 'writing' models with the links already whitelisted in the finetuning.

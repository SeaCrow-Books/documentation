This is a strategy for repurposed content. This is sometimes called the content engine approach. 

For this to work large pieces of content are repurposed into smaller snippets for social media. This mass of smaller content all point back to a single point or product. This creates a swarm of content to fill the top of the funnel. 

The aim is to develop a marketing strategy that can be used alongside SEO magnet content. Whilst magnet content remains the primary marketing channel, this approach will do three things:

1. Provide a short term scattered promotion of our books. 
2. Create new back links. 
3. Push people to the blog to collect emails.

The start of this approach is to create long form weekly blood posts. 

These are formatted and written in a way that allows them to be segmented for other platforms. The content is adjusted to meet additional platform. 

These includes:

- linked in
- Instagram
- Facebook
- twitter
- tiktok

The goal is presence and persistence. These need to link to the website where possible to increase back links. 

There's no point until we have free contab the goal here is email capture.

In conjunction to this we will be using paid Amazon ads. 

## Pillar model

This is a cluster model with key pillars e.g. developmental editing with a cluster of posts. The pillars are interlinked.

Pillars should be things you can write multiple topics about, so not just 'developmental editing' but say 'self ediing'. If a subject has multiple possible topics it becomes a pillar.

Each post should start with a summary, which is in essence chasing a featured snippet, the a toc, also faq.

The snippet should be 45 words..

## Thoughts

Since the main format is text I should create and distribute text. Video is needed for TikTok, but this can be converting text. 

Create puller content that can be split

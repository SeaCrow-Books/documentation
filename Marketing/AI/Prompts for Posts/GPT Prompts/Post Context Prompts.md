These are prompts used to establish the initial context of a post.

When dealing with Chat GPT it's a good idea to talk it like you would a coworker that needs to know the entire scope of the project you are undertaking. That means providing context in the beginning, but also a giving a breakdown of the steps/outline that it should be conforming to. 

Breaking down the steps is helpful because you can then later tell chat "Okay, moving on to this section" and it will pull context from your initial prompt, thus keeping it aligned with your ultimate goal. (If you don't know the full scope/outline of your project, spend time with Chat devising it first).

You might not use all these elements, or you might include additional ones; use your own discretion.

When writing a Pillar Post, use the following Pillar Post Context Prompt Template.
- Replace the brackets with your own information as relevant

>[!Prompt: Pillar Post Context Prompt Template]
>
>This is a context prompt, do not start writing the project
>I am writing a (pillar post) for a (romance) blog about (Speculative Romance). I want you to list the main sub-genres under this category, which include (sub-genre a), (sub-genre b) and (sub-genre c). 
>
>I will be using the following outline for my post:
>- Title
>- Tagline
>- Brief introduction about the genre, focusing on (it's popularity, appeal). 
>- Still in the introduction, we will include a short description of what the post will be discussing, mentioning the main genres and creating a sense of anticipation for the rest of the post.
>- A short, one-sentence segue leading to the post itself
>- Then I will be following a pattern of:
>- - Describing the main genre
>- - A one-line segue
>- - Breaking down each sub-genre under the main one
>- - A one-line segue
>- - Breaking down each trope associated to the sub-genres within this main genre
>- Then I will repeat the above pattern for all the remaining main genres
>- Then a deeper reflection section disguised by a long string keyword, like (How have these genres Stayed Relevant?)
>- - Make it a short, three-paragraph reflection that does not repeat what has already been said, but adds additional insight, commentary, or predictions for future trends.
>- Frequently Asked Questions: Create this section with a header, the questions and answers will be added later.
>- Conclusion: we won't summarize or reiterate what has been said, but instead provide a personal opinion, take-away, and finally a segue that calls the reader to look out for future posts.

# Things to remember:
- At this point, it's a good idea to ask Chat GPT what additional context it might want or need. However, most of that should already have been done during your planning stage.
- Your outline (and the content/thought directions within it) might look different, but try to break it down for Chat in the same way.
- If Chat recommends additional context and you decide to include it, rewrite the initial prompt and either start in a new chat or tell Chat GPT this is the updated context. Otherwise, Chat can get confused about what "context snippet" is accorded a higher priority and it will skew your results.

After priming your chat with the context prompt, make sure to follow the [[Pillar Post Workflow]]

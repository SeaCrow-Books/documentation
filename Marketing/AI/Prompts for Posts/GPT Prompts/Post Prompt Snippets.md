## Creating links
Where relevant, include links to external websites that provide more information on notable works, authors, or key terms mentioned. These should enhance the reading experience. They should also be href anchor tags. e.g. \<a href="">link\</a>

Stick to using the following sites unless you feel there is another site that adds particular value to the reader.

- Wikipedia

Don't make up links, this is important.  ^6bf07a

## Creating HTML
The output should be in HTML format such as \<p>text here\</p> tags. You don't need to add \<html> or \<body> tags, these are provided elsewhere.   ^bd912c

## Creating a title

I want to write this post with you step by step. first off, we need a good title, please provide five alternatives. remember to maintain that 7 out of ten tone

(if you're having trouble, just keep asking for more and think about guiding the "sentence structure of the title")

## Creating a tagline

Wonderful, now give me 5 good taglines for the post. Please use a different sentence structure/formula than the (title's). Meaning, if it uses a colon, don't do so for the tagline.

## Honing Content Generation

No matter how well you craft a set prompt, it will perform differently each time you use it. A good way to ensure consistency is:
- Have Chat generate two paragraphs with your prompt, like the subgenre or trope prompt.
- Edit it yourself to a higher standard
- Feed it back to Chat and ask it what it learned from the edit
- If you like the answer, tell it to apply the same principles to future answers in the chat.

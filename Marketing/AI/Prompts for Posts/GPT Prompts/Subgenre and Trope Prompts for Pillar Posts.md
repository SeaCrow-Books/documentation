### Subgenre

>[!prompt]
>
>Please write two paragraphs for each subgenre. Where relevant, mention if and how they might relate to one another, however don't try and reach for a connection that doesn't exist. Please give a short explanation of each, highlighting the main points of interest or things they are famous for. if you are aware of any trends for any of the genres, please mention them too.  Where relevant, please include mentions of genre subversion, overlap/fusion with the other subgenres, reader reception/popularity, influence from other genres, and cultural impact. however, only do so when you know it to be true, and alternate between these elements for each subgenre. I don't need all that information for every subgenre, so use your discretion to ensure variability (high priority).

rework these prompts to prioritize variability. Chat still likes to come up with its own little formulae and just spitting out the same stuff for each section. Include a clause for "do not repeat information by saying it in a different way, if you don't have anything new to say, don't day anything." Also, tell Chat to take the contextual composition of each section into account to make sure all information is novel. In other words, the description section and trendsetting section should not repeat info. 
an interesting thought, I think variability is broken when you take one element in a prompt and list it apart from the rest, for example: Trends should be part of the listed elements you want it vary between.

# Refresher Prompts (name under review)

Have "refresher" or "re-focusing" prompts that reiterate your priorities. These are separate from the content prompting, instead they remind Chat that you want your output in a certain manner. 
The main use case I have in mind is to prioritize randomization/natural writing flows that break up the monotony of Chat's responses. 
Keywords to use when crafting these prompts include:
- Utilize Diverse Structures:  Instead of following the same pattern for every topic category, vary the structure of responses. This can include starting with a brief anecdote, posing rhetorical questions, or employing different approaches to introduce the category and its elements.
- Varied Elements: While you continue to provide the desired elements (like descriptions, sources of suspense, reader perception, and other relevant information) ensure that these elements are more tailored to each category. Avoid creating a repetitive feeling and prioritize a more engaging narrative.

I think we will need to reiterate these prompts every time we start with a new section of a post.
#suggestion flesh out this idea in the custom instructions as well, we really need to hammer at this to create engaging and novel content.


# Inferential Prompts
I touched on this idea in the subgenre and trope prompts, but I think it might be worth creating a separate master prompt for this (or including it in the custom instructions). 

The idea here is to create prompts that force Chat to link the different knowledge points that it has on a subject together and make inferences about them. Basically, we need to lean into the "lying" and "hallucinating" problem of Chat and use it to come up with accurate and convincing conclusions/inferences about a topic or scenario by referencing related topics in a knowledgeable (or pseudo-knowledgeable) manner.

Basically, we want to simulate subject-specific experience and knowledge.

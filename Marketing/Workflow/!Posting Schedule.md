>[!caution] I will add an editable version of the schedule once I figure out markdown tables


**70% of posts should be transactional posts:**
- Best of (these)
- Comparisons / Versus
- Reviews
- Upcoming and recents

**30% of posts should be informational and engaging:**
- What is? (subgenres, lingo, stereotypes etc.)
- Parody post or other fun post
- Reader roundups - compile online reviews and show a statistic of a book (be fake positive where possible so we don’t slander an author)

Eventually, a month’s posting schedule will look like this:

- Try to start every month with an Upcoming or similar (recents)
- For Parody, consider doing the A Conservative's Guide to Erotic Fiction where you humorously discuss lingo, genres, tropes, etc. in Layman's terms. This blog author will also create one of the free cheat sheets
- Please see the [[Post Ideas]] document for inspiration.

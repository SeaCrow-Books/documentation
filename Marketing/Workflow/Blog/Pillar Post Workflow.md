>[!Note] Remember to follow the [[!AI Best Practices for Blog Posts]] workflow as well

## Step 1. Planning and Research
- After confirming your topic, spend time with ChatGPT (and other online sources) to establish and compile a list  of all the subgenres and tropes for your pillar post (or equivalent elements for different pillar post types).
- Make sure that all relevant topics have been properly expanded on. After the Research stage you shouldn't need to prompt anything like "recommend additional elements". See our #Golden-Rule.

## Step 2. Load your Custom Instructions
## Custom Instructions

Use the following prompt to set the custom instructions within ChatGPT.

## Step 3. Define the Post Outline through Context Prompt
### Context Prompt

This is the initial prompt to prepare ChatGPT to create the pillar post. It is also intended to give ChatGPT an idea of the outline you will be following. This helps when you want to tell Chat, "Okay, now we're moving on to this section," later on.

### Toning


![[Post Toning#^toning-prompt]]


## Step 4. Write Main Body of the Post

Now that all the instructions, context, and tone are loaded you can prompt ChatGPT for the individual sections of the Pillar Post. There are a lot of in-between prompts that you should use when you aren't happy with the text it generates. 

For example:

- I don't like that title, please give me 5 alternatives.
- I don't like your structure for the tagline, please write 5 similar ones to this (example)
- The introduction is too shallow. Please focus more on these elements (list) to provide more valuable information
A list of these types of prompts is currently #in-development, #todo, so please use your own creativity and discretion in the meantime.

### Pillar Post Introduction Prompt

``` Copy

Write a three paragraph introduction for (this pillar post), containing the following elements:
- Briefly explain the overarching genre, (insert here)
- Focus on the importance, popularity, and alure of the genre
- Mention the main subgenres underneath this genre that will be covered in this post, (insert here)
- Write a short segue telling the reader you will now provide a detailed breakdown of each subgenres elements.

```

The main focus of the Genre Pillar Posts are to provide detailed breakdowns of their subgenres and tropes. 

First, provide a two-paragraph description of the main subgenre before delving into its sub-subgenres and tropes.

Then provide the sub-subgenre breakdowns. To do this, please use the prompts below. Please include a single sentence segue between the Subgenre and Trope breakdowns.
### Subgenre

### Tropes

## Step 5. Write the Summary, FAQ and Conclusion 
#suggestion should the FAQ and conclusion be swapped in order?

A short breakdown of these sections are written in the Context Prompt's outline, but please see the below instructions as well.
### 5.1 Summary
You have some wiggle room on what you want to include in this section, here are some options:
- Ask Chat to focus on each main subgenres’ (list them in brackets for clarity) unique trajectories over the years, what makes each of them appealing, and what they offer readers on a deeper level.
- Or ask for a deeper reflection disguised by a long string keyword, like (How have these genres Stayed Relevant?)
- Delve into the sociocultural  sociocultural factors affecting the overarching genre. Lay the groundwork for future posts, delving into how these factors have specifically influenced sub-genres.
 Be sure to make it a short, two-to-three paragraph reflection that does not repeat what has already been said, but adds additional insight, commentary, or predictions for future trends.

### 5.2 FAQ
- Frequently Asked Questions: Create this section with a header, the questions and answers will be added later.

### 5.3 Conclusion

In this section be sure you don't summarize or reiterate what has been said,  instead provide a personal opinion and an overall take-away from the post. Finally, include a short call to action tells the reader to look out for future posts, link to a relevant one, or link to free content.
Ensure that the focus is on offering valuable insights and rounding the post up neatly, leaving the reader eager for future posts.

This approach is sometimes called a 'cluster' model.

The approach looks to create content that is optimized for search engines and presents the kinds of information they are looking to rank. This means that content is created from a 'search engine first' viewpoint. 

The aim is to create a 'web' of content on any given topic that can catch a user with a very specific query and position them in a place where they can quickly access a mass of relevant information. 

The traditional way of thinking about SEO is to rank for the most popular key phrase. This used to work but as Google has become more sophisticated it understands that a users journey is complex and branching, not linear. This means that the aim is to offer Google with the web of content it knows a user si likely to want to access in their journey. When they see this behavior, they rank all of the posts higher.

This means that you have to shake the idea that you are creating content to sell and, instead, provide the indepth and broad content that Google expects to see. This might mean talking about a competitor.

The approach has the added advantage that ranking for the number one, most competitive key phrases is not longer important and can be ignored. Instead, effort is spent in creating content that is niche and specific. This not only helps users to have a better experience but also gives Google the type of user behavior it is seeking.

The approach is to create top level general pillar posts, this is followed by more specific sub-pillar and finally niche blog posts. 

Since this map is giving Google what it needs, the need for back links can be ignored. It may be advantageous to have a small amount of paid search but this is simply to 'flag', the system to Google and should only be used once a network is set up. 

### Setting up the Network
The following steps can be used to set up a network.

1. Identify the mission critical keyword or phrase that matches the business. e.g. Book Editing or Content Marketing. 
2. Identify the key phrases that represent the important topics. 
3. Create a 16 piece pillar startegy

### 16 Piece Pillar Strategy

![[Pasted image 20231127104925.png]]

For each pillar you need the following:

- 1  x Pillar post with 3000+ words containing 20 keywords.
- 3 x Sub-pillar with 2000+ words containing 15 keywords.
- 3 x Blog with 1000+ words for each sub-pillar containing 8 keywords.

**It is important that the key phrase from the level above is mentioned in the content body.**

Blog post titles are created from the questions triggered by the sub-pillar post. When writing blog posts, this are based around the questions that people ask in relation to the titles. Theses should be h2.

So...

Title - What is the best way to write a blog post?

h2 - answer 1 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

h2 - answer 2 to this question.
text - the answer to this question. 

### Waves
The initial implementation is important. 

1. Publish the pillar post and tell Google and wait for it to be seen.
2. Publish all sub-pillars at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 
3. 2. Publish all blogs at once, tell Google and wait for them to be seen. 

Content should always be added in waves.

Main advantages:

- More rapid results, often weeks not months. 

This is a cluster model with key pillars e.g. developmental editing with a cluster of posts. The pillars are interlinked.

Pillars should be things you can write multiple topics about, so not just 'developmental editing' but say 'self ediing'. If a subject has multiple possible topics it becomes a pillar.

Each post should start with a summary, which is in essence chasing a featured snippet, the a toc, also faq.

The snippet should be 45 words..

This document outline the first phase of the SeaCrow marketing strategy. This will be applied until we have a mature marketing platform producing consists results. 

## Ethos
The aim of the first phase of the marketing strategy is simple. It is to drive as much targeted traffic to the website where they can sign up for magent content and enter our sales funnel. 

In order to achieve this we will implement three key tactics:

1. [[Pillar Posting]]
2. [[Content Engine]]
3. [[Spine Email Drip]]

The implementation of these three tactics create robust marketing funnel. 
### [[Pillar Posting]]
This is a blog post writing strategy where a series of pillar topics are identified. A general pillar post is created for the topic and then a series of support posts created over time. 
### [[Content Engine]]
This is a content creation strategy that looks to create long form content that is then split into small sections for social media. 
### [[Spine Email Drip]]
This is a tactic that combines a never ending email drip system (spine), with smaller email loops that are triggered by user actions.

- --no red eyes

- ==Things to watch out for:==
	- Certain subjects and genres are “highly charged” keywords. Meaning, so many of these images were used when training Midjourney that it has very specific ideas on how to portray them. This can be good in that it gives us the exact “feel” we want, but it can also get in your way and force your prompt in a direction that you don’t want.
	- Always go over an image you intend to use and look for any abnormalities; including, warped hands and feet, misplaced items (like a glass floating or not on a surface commonly used to put a glass
- If you want to include a “photo” instead, please see our Midjourney camera/lighting/mood prompts below.

## Image Style Match

Midjourney won’t always give consistent images, but we are after a specific style so that all our images share the same stylistic “thread”. This is why we simply use “impressionism, flat illustration style”. Characteristics of our style include simple illustrations, details represented by colour “smears”. Below are examples of preferred images.

  

Here image 1 and 3 fit our style the best. Image two is close, and image 4 is too far from what we want.

Here image 2 and especially image 3 have the same detail “smears” that we want included in our images. Image 4 is just too simplistic and void of details. Please note that all 4 have proportion issues and none of them would be viable to use on the site.

All of these images comply with the style we want. But again, the proporstions are a bit off.

The second and third images below fit our style really well (though a bit too detailed, it’s not a big issue). However only image 3 has the glass and book in good proportions.

The point of our style is to be adaptable to any genre, as is evident below. All of the images below would fit our style perfectly.

If you are struggling with too many details and you want the image that doesn’t draw too much attention to itself, you can include “palette knife drawing” with the option of dropping “expressionism”. However, this should not be standard practice and your chosen result should still match the company style. Here’s an example below.

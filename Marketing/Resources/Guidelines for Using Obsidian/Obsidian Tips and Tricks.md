This is an outline for the best practice when it comes to using Obsidian.
## Tags
You can add tags: #test-tag
I think we need a rationale for using tags. 
I am not sure how these work yet but seem cool and useful.

## Creating a Link to Discord
The capability to link from Obsidian to a Discord channel is not directly built into Obsidian, but there are some workarounds and strategies that could help you achieve this. Below are a few methods you can consider:
### Method 1: Using Discord Channel URL

1. **Get the Discord Channel URL**: In Discord, you can right-click on a text channel and select "Copy ID" if you have Developer Mode enabled in Discord settings. The ID can be used to create a URL like `https://discord.com/channels/[ServerID]/[ChannelID]`.
    
2. **Create a Markdown Link in Obsidian**: In Obsidian, you can create a link to the Discord channel using Markdown syntax like this `[Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/[ServerID]/[ChannelID])`.
    
    **Note**: This method will open the link in your default web browser, and you'll need to have access to the Discord server and channel for the link to work.
